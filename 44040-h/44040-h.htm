<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this day the man who writes a
useless book, commits a great sin against society.&nbsp; The aim
of this volume is utility; although the word, as applied to it,
must be interpreted in a very limited sense.&nbsp; Beyond a
circuit of a few miles it will have no interest; and even in
respect to its legitimate sphere it only assumes to be a record
of facts by which the man in public life may refresh his memory
as to the particulars of past events, or by which those who have
lived and moved amongst the occurrences here set down may call up
pleasant associations of things and times gone by.&nbsp; By its
means all persons resident in or connected with Worcestershire
may possess themselves of a knowledge of the history of the
County during the century, besides having at their command a
repertory of all the principal events of the locality.&nbsp; It
would in many instances have been more gratifying to the writer
to have exchanged the chronicle for the narrative&mdash;the annal
for something more pretentious as a history, but the
&ldquo;utility&rdquo; of the book would thereby have been
impaired, and he refrained.&nbsp; To have attempted a
continuation of <i>Nash</i> would have been mere pedantry, and
the mode would have been wholly unsuitable for a record of modern
Worcestershire.&nbsp; As for the opinions which may be found
scattered here and there on the following pages, the writer is no
further anxious about them than as being naturally desirous that
what he believes to be truth should be accepted and acted upon by
others.&nbsp; But as to the facts professed to be narrated, he
hopes that they will be found scrupulously accurate and
undistorted by anything like party bias; of the faults of
omission, no one can be so conscious as the writer himself, but
the book, even now, is larger than he had at first
intended.&nbsp; If errors should be found, those whose censure
would be the weightiest will readily be able to suggest abundance
of excuses, and to their forbearance he unhesitatingly trusts the
following pages.</p>

1</span>WORCESTERSHIRE IN THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> entering on a detail of
occurrences which possess, comparatively speaking, only an
isolated interest, I shall occupy a few pages in the
consideration of some general facts and statistics, which may
enable the reader to judge of the advance which the County of
Worcester has made during a truly remarkable half-century.&nbsp;
No former period in the world&rsquo;s history ever witnessed such
mental activity and progress.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Increase of Population</span>, though
not a perfect test of general prosperity, yet indicates that the
employments which engage the attention of the inhabitants of any
given district are flourishing, that there is no such apprehended
deficiency of the articles of wealth as seriously to check
marriage, and that there is an absence of some of those evils
which are constantly at work to retard the replenishment of the
earth by the human family.&nbsp; For the statistics of population
in this county I refer the reader to Table 1, in the Appendix,
from which he will perceive that a continuous, and in some
instances a rapid increase has taken place in the manufacturing
districts.&nbsp; Until the last ten years, however, the increase
of population in this county, though exceeding that of many
counties, did not quite come up to the average increase of the
entire <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>kingdom.&nbsp; The rate of increase from 1801 to 1811,
was&mdash;</p>

</table>
<p>From 1841 to 1851, the rate of increase for Worcestershire was
slightly above the average, being as nearly as possible 13 per
cent., while that of England, as a whole, had declined, and was
only about 12.7.&nbsp; This is a fact upon which no
interpretation can be put, except such as is flattering to the
condition and prospects of our county.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Emigration</span> has been slowly going on from our
manufacturing districts during the last fifteen years, but there
has been no remarkable exodus at any particular period.&nbsp;
Many farm labourers and small occupants of land have also been
seduced by the Mormons to seek an imaginary paradise in the Far
West.&nbsp; Even this desultory emigration cannot but be
beneficial.&nbsp; Great Britain has yet, however, to acquire the
practical wisdom of the ancients in carrying out a systematic
colonization, and it still remains for her people to perform the
noble mission which their national advantages and insular
position seem to assign them&mdash;that of peopling the solitudes
of the earth with a race which has hitherto proved equal to all
difficulties, and who would carry with them the laws of an
Alfred, the language of a Shakspere, and, above all, the
ennobling influences of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>A tabular statement of <span class="smcap">Criminals</span>
convicted, and of the nature of the sentences inflicted upon
them, will also be found in the Appendix.&nbsp; When the
improvement in the machinery for detecting crimes and bringing
offenders to justice is taken into account, there would not seem
to be any serious increase in the amount of crime committed; but
there certainly is no room for believing that the <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>intelligence of
the age, or the activity of the police, have been successful in
diminishing it.&nbsp; Neither does the comparative leniency of
the punishments inflicted afford any proof that the crimes
committed are less heinous than formerly.&nbsp; The decrease in
severity of punishments is to be attributed solely to the
amelioration of our criminal code, and the humane desire to
reclaim rather than to punish, which now distinguishes our
legislature and even pervades the judiciary.&nbsp;
Worcestershire, it must be admitted, holds a bad pre&euml;minence
both in respect to the number and character of the offences
committed within its boundaries: a recent return, made by order
of the Privy Council, assigns it the very lowest place amongst
the English counties as to the proportion of criminals to the
population, and within three of the bottom of the list in degree
of crime.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Education</span> is regarded by many as
the panacea which is to empty our prisons and render the
judge&rsquo;s office a sinecure; and, without being inclined to
attribute to it any such efficacy, it cannot be doubted that it
does act as a check to the commission of many of the grosser
offences against society.&nbsp; A private individual has not at
his command the means necessary to compile complete statistics on
a subject like this; it is a matter of congratulation, however,
that Government caused inquiries to be made, at the last census,
which will by and by put us in possession of much important
information on this head.&nbsp; Without pretending to accuracy, I
believe it will be found that there are in Worcestershire about
550 private and public day and boarding schools, having
accommodation for the instruction of 20,000 scholars.&nbsp; It is
not, indeed, want of accommodation that is now so much to be
complained of&mdash;for few of the school-rooms are
filled&mdash;as inferiority in the quality of the instruction
imparted.&nbsp; Earnest efforts are, however, being made by all
educational societies and the supporters of public schools to
remedy the admitted deficiency.&nbsp; <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Nearly all the schools now existing in
the county, with the exception of the Grammar and Free Schools of
which there are some seventy-six, have been founded during the
present century, and owe their existence, and in greatest part
their continuance, to the voluntary benevolence of persons
residing on the spot.&nbsp; Within the last three or four years,
public attention has been much directed to the lax administration
of the funds of the various charity schools in the county, and
should the gentlemen who have taken the matter so zealously in
hand be successful in bringing about the reforms which these
institutions so imperatively need, the poor of many future
generations will have reason to thank them for their
labours.&nbsp; I must not omit to notice here the means which
have been taken in the latter part of this half-century to induce
a love and pursuit of knowledge amongst the working classes, by
the establishment of Mechanics&rsquo; Institutions, one of which
is now to be found in almost every town in the county.&nbsp; The
elder born of these societies are, unfortunately, already passing
to decay, and, as at present conducted, they do not seem to
possess any inherent vitality.&nbsp; They have undoubtedly been
useful in displaying the more attractive results of study and
science&mdash;the flowers by the wayside, which may tempt
triflers to venture a short distance on Learning&rsquo;s easier
paths&mdash;but they offer little or no assistance to those who
would resolutely dare its difficult ascents.&nbsp; The efforts of
the friends of education should be directed to making these
institutions what their projector, Lord Brougham, intended they
should be&mdash;People&rsquo;s Colleges.</p>
<p>An estimate of the provision made for <span
class="smcap">Religious Instruction</span> in this county will be
found in the Appendix&mdash;Table No. 3.&nbsp; The Established
Church, by new buildings or enlargements, has increased the
accommodation for attendants on its forms of worship, since the
year 1800, by one fifth to one fourth.&nbsp; Upon looking at the
large numbers <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>provided for by Wesleyanism, in its various forms, the
thought cannot but occur that if the Church of England could have
retained John Wesley and his followers, as Rome did St. Francis
D&rsquo;Assissi, to be its evangelists among the masses of the
population, it must have received a vast accession of
strength.&nbsp; The Wesleyans in forsaking their first simple
object of evangelism for that of building up a permanent
ecclesiastical polity, seem to have mistaken the source of their
own power, and during the last two years their numbers have
considerably decreased from disaffection in the body.&nbsp; The
Independents and Baptists have been deficient in proselytism,
conceiving their special mission to be to keep in purity the
faith committed to them from their Puritan forefathers.&nbsp; The
Unitarians and Friends are stationary sects.&nbsp; The Roman
Catholics have built ten small chapels in this county during the
present century, and as to numbers, they have barely kept pace
with the increase of population.&nbsp; The annual value of church
livings in this county is about &pound;62,000; the income of the
See of Worcester is fixed at &pound;5,000; and the net revenue of
the Dean and Chapter of Worcester is returned at
&pound;8,698.&nbsp; The various bodies of Protestant Dissenters
raise at least &pound;20,000 annually for the support of their
ministers, Sabbath schools, missions, and other religious
institutions.</p>
<p>This county yields at once the richest fruits of the soil and
the most practically valuable mineral productions.&nbsp; The
total acreage of the county, exclusive of roads and rivers, is
431,616; and by far the larger portion of this surface is devoted
to <span class="smcap">Agriculture</span>.&nbsp; According to Mr.
Fowler&rsquo;s valuation, made in the year 1842, the total value
of property assessable to the county rate is &pound;912,863; of
which &pound;263,000 may be taken as representing the rental of
buildings and land in the towns and manufacturing districts,
leaving &pound;650,000 as the annual value of agricultural
property.&nbsp; In this statement the city of Worcester, the
rateable <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>rental of which is about &pound;75,000, is, of course,
not included.&nbsp; If it is assumed that 380,000 acres are
arable and grass land, that will probably be an approximation to
the truth.&nbsp; In the total absence of agricultural statistics
any attempt to compute the present produce of the county would be
quite out of the question, but that it has greatly increased of
late years cannot be doubted.&nbsp; A gentleman, upon whose
practical knowledge and information the most entire reliance may
be placed, informs me that the average yield per acre throughout
the Vale of Evesham is now about 27 bushels in wheat, 32 in
barley, 40 in oats, 27 in beans; and that there has been an
increase of fully 15 per cent. in the wheat and barley crops, and
of 10 per cent. in the bean crop, within the last 20 or 25
years.&nbsp; Hops, however, for which this county has been and
still is so famous, have to a great extent gone out of
cultivation; and while at the beginning of the century some 6,000
acres were devoted to their growth, there are now not more than
1,625 acres of hop plantation.&nbsp; With regard to the general
progress of agriculture, the half-century may be divided into
three periods.&nbsp; During the war the high prices of provisions
stimulated improvement, and much drainage was then done, though
in so rude and unscientific a way that it has since been found
necessary to replace a great deal of it.&nbsp; The Earl of
Plymouth, the Earl of Coventry, and A. Lechmere, Esq., in this
county, very early bestowed great pains on the drainage of their
estates.&nbsp; From 1814 to 1830 agriculture, comparatively
speaking, was at a stand still; <a name="citation6"></a><a
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a> but during the last
twenty years many and signal improvements have <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>been made in
its science.&nbsp; Many persons still living can recollect whole
hamlets and villages in this county in which there was scarce an
enclosure; and nearly the whole of the land was cultivated in
common by the resident farmers, to each one of whom would be
assigned a certain quantity in wheat, barley, vetches, and
fallow.&nbsp; Between each ploughed land was left a strip of
mere, into which the surface water from the adjoining ridges all
sank and rendered it little better than a constant bog, which
diseased the few poor sheep grazing upon it and made the ague a
common and hereditary ill to farmer and labourer alike.&nbsp; The
amount of unenclosed land now to be found in the county is quite
unimportant; thorough drainage is regarded as essential to all
cultivation; burnt soil has been much used to lighten the heavy
clays; manures of all kinds are extensively employed; and
implements of a very improved and economic description are used
in almost every farming operation.&nbsp; The increased
cultivation of the turnip, and better management of the clay
fallows, are marked features in Worcestershire agricultural
improvements.&nbsp; Clay lands, that formerly were allowed to lie
fallow every fourth or fifth year, are now planted with vetches,
and sheep-folded.&nbsp; A remarkable advance, too, has been made
in the character of the stock reared, especially in the size and
quality of the sheep.&nbsp; The better drainage of the land has
prevented much of the disease which used formerly to thin out the
flocks year by year, and there has been no serious rot in the
county since 1831.&nbsp; The local agricultural societies, which
have been established during the last fifteen years, have done
much by their premiums and annual exhibitions to stimulate
improvement, but our chief confidence for progress in the future
lies in our being able to number amongst our landowners and
occupiers men of intelligence and enterprise, who, in all
quarters of the county, are seriously engaged in adjusting the
relations of landlord and <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>tenant to the circumstances of the
times, and by improved modes of farm management and cultivation
seeking to meet successfully unrestricted foreign
competition.</p>
<p>Our mineral productions are <span class="smcap">Coal</span>
and <span class="smcap">Iron</span>, both of which are found in
large quantities at the northern extremity of the county, and
coal is also raised in the neighbourhood of Bewdley.&nbsp; The
Dudley division of the South Staffordshire coal field is
celebrated for producing what is known as the ten yard or thick
coal&mdash;so named because the bed is thirty feet in
thickness.&nbsp; It is, indeed, the largest and most important
bed of coal in the kingdom, and its good qualities are too well
known to every housekeeper in this district to need that I should
expatiate upon them here.&nbsp; With the associated thin coals
and ironstone this bed is worth at least &pound;1,000 per
acre.&nbsp; The number of tons of coal raised in the Dudley
district (Worcestershire only) during 1851 may be approximately
reckoned at 700,000, worth perhaps &pound;25,000.&nbsp; It was in
this district that coal was first used for the purpose of
smelting iron, in the year 1619.&nbsp; The duties on the
introduction of foreign iron were cither removed or rendered
merely nominal in 1826, and the production has since nearly
quadrupled, and now amounts to 2,250,000 tons annually.&nbsp; The
South Staffordshire and Worcestershire iron district ranks second
in importance, far surpassing Scotland in the manufacture of
wrought iron, and the quality is superior to that of South
Wales.&nbsp; The number of furnaces now in blast in this county
is twenty-eight, and eighteen out of blast.&nbsp; Nearly 150,000
tons of iron were made here in 1851, and prices ranged from 50s.
to 57s. 6d. hot blast; cold blast, 60s. to 67s. 6d.; best makes,
120s., and second ditto, 110s. per ton.&nbsp; The make of iron
has not greatly increased in Worcestershire during the last few
years, but no branch of our productive industry rests on surer
foundations, or has more prospect of continuous extension, than
the iron trade.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The <span
class="smcap">Glass</span> manufacture, of which Stourbridge is a
principal seat, affords a most striking instance of the tendency
of excessive duties, collected under regulations which interfere
with and cramp industrial processes.&nbsp; In 1811 the home
consumption of glass amounted to 417,911 cwt.: in 1812 the excise
duties on this article were doubled; the average consumption of
the next three years was but 264,931 cwt.; and up to the time of
the reduction of the duties by two-thirds, in 1835, there had
been no increase whatever in the consumption of British glass
since the commencement of the present century.&nbsp; Since the
entire abolition of the duties, in 1845, the consumption has
increased to a surprising extent, and glass has been applied to
uses previously undreamt of.&nbsp; The manufacture was introduced
into Stourbridge, about 1556, by refugees from Lorraine, and has
continued to flourish there ever since.&nbsp; The descriptions
principally made here are flint, bottle, and chemical utensil
glass.&nbsp; There are now twelve glass manufactories in the town
and neighbourhood, employing about 1,050 pairs of hands, and the
trade generally is in a prosperous state.&nbsp; The manufacture
of <span class="smcap">Fire Bricks</span>, and the sale of clay
for glass works, is a trade at Stourbridge, now almost as
important as the manufacture of glass itself; and as it is one
with the details of which the public are not generally
conversant, I shall enter somewhat into particulars.&nbsp;
Beneath all coal strata is found a clay, which, from the
peculiarity of its ingredients, is remarkably well adapted to
stand the action of intense heat.&nbsp; An analysis of the best
clay raised at Stourbridge, gives</p>

presence of lime or iron in any considerable quantities would
render the clay fusible, but when the silica and alumina so
greatly preponderate, it will stand any amount of heat that can
be raised in ordinary furnaces.&nbsp; The best clay fetches about
55s. per ton, and is used for glass-house pots and the bricks
used in making glass furnaces, not only in England but other
countries; it is exported to North America in large quantities,
and to South America, France, Holland, and Germany.&nbsp; Besides
the best clay, inferior descriptions called
&ldquo;seconds,&rdquo; &ldquo;black,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;offal&rdquo; clay are raised to a considerable
extent.&nbsp; The first (black), mixed in certain proportions
with &ldquo;seconds,&rdquo; potsherds, &amp;c., is chiefly used
for making crucibles, in which metals are melted; and of these
Birmingham alone takes about 100 dozen weekly from this
district.&nbsp; The &ldquo;offal clay,&rdquo; or that which is
raised from the mine in the mixed or broken state, is not
&ldquo;picked&rdquo; (or selected), but ground and sold at 10s.
per ton: with this the great bulk of fire bricks are made.&nbsp;
The trade is one of ancient date; Rufford&rsquo;s clay works have
been carried on during the whole of this century under the same
name, but its principal development has taken place within the
last forty years.&nbsp; Formerly the owners did not get half the
best or other clays, and forty years ago there was no better
speculation than taking to what was then considered a broken, or
worked-out mine.&nbsp; Nor did they attempt any but square or
roughly-made bricks, whereas the trade now can model and finish
neatly.&nbsp; Even now the capabilities of Stourbridge fire clay
are not generally understood.&nbsp; It has had a steady
unfluctuating demand, and notwithstanding the discovery of fire
clay in various parts of the island, Stourbridge never did a
larger business than at present.&nbsp; The Stourbridge clays and
bricks are sold freely both in the north and in Wales.&nbsp;
About 15,000 tons of best clay are raised annually in the
Stourbridge district.&nbsp; There are <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>four proprietors of clay mines in
Stourbridge, and two firms renting mines; five out of the six
being also manufacturers of fire bricks and other articles in
which the clay is used.&nbsp; The fire bricks are made of all
sizes; the largest kept in regular stock weighs 635lbs.&nbsp; The
glass-house bricks are sold &ldquo;green&rdquo; (dry) and but
seldom burnt.&nbsp; The common description for gas works, iron
works, and all other purposes, are burnt.&nbsp; About 14,000,000
of bricks of all descriptions are made annually in the
Stourbridge district, consuming about 46,000 tons of clay, and
may be valued at &pound;50,000.&nbsp; An important branch of the
trade, and one which has been gradually increasing for the last
seven years, is the manufacture of clay retorts for gas works,
and they are now generally preferred to metal.&nbsp; The most
striking purpose to which the fire clay has been turned is the
manufacture of large baths in one piece.&nbsp; At the suggestion
of Prince Albert, the Society of Arts in 1846 offered a premium
for the production of such an article, and in 1850 one was made
at the works of F. T. Rufford, Esq., which gained the Gold Isis
Medal.&nbsp; It had been thought impossible to manufacture such
an article in one piece because of the great contraction which
all pottery undergoes in burning, but after much patient
experiment, the ingenuity and skill of the practical men in Mr.
Rufford&rsquo;s works produced a perfect and beautiful vessel
which may be said to be imperishable, will never discolour, is
cleansed without labour, and is incapable of retaining the poison
of any contagious disease in an active form.&nbsp; The clearness
of the colour (white or marbled) is effected by veneering china
on the inner surface of the fire clay, and the contractile effect
of burning is overcome by assimilating the two clays.&nbsp; Many
public baths are now supplied with this useful article, which
bids fair altogether to supersede the metallic baths.&nbsp; The
number of hands employed at Stourbridge in the manufacture of
bricks and other articles <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>from fire clay is about 900.&nbsp;
The town has been considerably improved since 1820: the bridge
over the Stour was widened in 1840; a new market hall has
recently been erected, and the inhabitants generally seem to have
somewhat of the spirit and enterprise expected in a flourishing
manufacturing place.</p>
<p>The manufactures of <span class="smcap">Kidderminster</span>
are of many years standing.&nbsp; In 1536 it was enacted that
&ldquo;No person of what degree or quality soever they be, shall
make within the shire of Worcester any manner of woollen cloths,
except only within the city of Worcester, the borough and towns
of Kidderminster, Evesham, Droitwich, and Bromsgrove, under pain
of forfeiting, for every broad cloth elsewhere made, the sum of
ten pounds;&rdquo; and in the time of Charles II an act was
passed &ldquo;for regulating the manufacture of Kidderminster
stuffs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Arras, frieze, cheneys and ratteens, poplin,
prunellas, rich brocades and quilted stuffs were all made here in
their turn, but the <span class="smcap">Carpet
Manufacture</span>, to which the town has entirely owed its
prosperity and fame in later years, was not introduced till the
middle of last century.&nbsp; At first the Scotch carpets only
were made, but afterwards Wilton and Brussels, and the
Kidderminster goods at once acquired celebrity for substantial
workmanship and brilliancy of colouring.&nbsp; At the beginning
of the present century there were probably about 400 looms at
work here, but there are now at least 3,000.&nbsp; The trade has
of course been subject to many fluctuations, and there have been
several seasons of severe distress amongst the weavers, which
have been for the most part coincident with stagnation in other
departments of manufacture, and are traceable to the same general
causes.&nbsp; During the last ten years the business has been
comparatively prosperous, there has been a great increase of
production, and the tapestry carpeting is largely exported to the
Continent, where its cheapness secures sale in the teeth of the
elegant, but costly, <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>&ldquo;velvets&rdquo; of
France.&nbsp; The many improvements which have been introduced
into the method of manufacture during the present century, have
principally had reference to the construction of the looms, and
economy in the amount of wool used; in design there is still
something to be accomplished.&nbsp; The principal varieties now
made are the ordinary Venetian carpeting, the Scotch or
Kidderminster, Brussels, Wilton, Genoa velvets, Axminster,
Saxony, and the patent tapestry carpetings, which last are among
the most recent and important introductions.&nbsp; Some of the
yarns employed in the fabrication of these were printed and
arranged in Halifax, under a patent from Messrs. Crossley, which
however expired in September last.&nbsp; Steam looms for tapestry
under patents from the same firm are already at work in the town,
and steam looms for the manufacture of Brussels carpeting are
about to be introduced, the effect of which, upon the general
character of the trade, must needs be exceedingly important; but
though the change can scarcely fail to occasion temporary
distress, it may fairly be hoped that, like all other
improvements, it will result in a large increase of the
manufacture, and add to the demand for labour and its
remuneration.&nbsp; The other manufactures carried on here,
principally relate to the preparation of leather; damask silks
are made by one manufacturer; and there are one or two spinning
mills.&nbsp; There are various tin forges in the neighbourhood,
and iron, tin, and screw works at Cookley employing many
hands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Redditch</span> and its neighbourhood is
the principal seat of the needle and fish hook manufactures in
this kingdom, and has been so for upwards of a century.&nbsp; In
1800 perhaps 500 persons found employment in this business at
Redditch, while the present number, including children, is at
least 2,300, and the quantity of needles made has increased from
150 to 1,000 millions per annum.&nbsp; A very large population is
also engaged in the manufacture, at Astwood Bank, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Feckenham,
Crab&rsquo;s Cross, &amp;c., but all the needles so made are
known as Redditch needles.&nbsp; The superiority of the article
manufactured here ensures it a sale all over the world, and it is
only in the common and inferior descriptions that the German
makers come into competition with those of this county; in fact,
the Germans themselves send to Redditch for their best
goods.&nbsp; Some very important improvements have been lately
introduced into the manufactories, and especially a contrivance
for carrying off the fine steel dust created in the operation of
grinding the needles, which was formerly very destructive of the
lives of the persons employed.&nbsp; The fish hook trade is
carried on to a considerable extent in this neighbourhood, and
large quantities of barbs, from the fly fisher&rsquo;s delicate
tackle to the whaler&rsquo;s harpoon, are annually exported to
all quarters of the globe.&nbsp; There is also one pin
manufactory in the town.&nbsp; The operative needle makers are
amongst the most intelligent of our artizans, and the future
prospects of the trade are in most respects encouraging.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nail Making</span> employs a large number
of people both at Bromsgrove and in the neighbourhood of
Stourbridge.&nbsp; In the former town and district there were,
some sixty years ago, only five or six nail masters or factors,
and not more than 400 or 500 persons engaged in the business, but
it now furnishes occupation for ten times that number.&nbsp;
Twenty-five years since the trade was in a prosperous state, but
about this time, owing to the demand being good, an inferior
article was made, with which the customers were dissatisfied; and
the result of this state of things was the invention of a machine
which, by singular ingenuity and application of mechanical skill,
cuts every part of the nail at once out of a solid sheet of
iron.&nbsp; The rapidity, ease, and cheapness with which nails
were thus multiplied, of course caused a great change in the
condition and prospects of the nail-making districts.&nbsp; The
demand, however, still <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>continues for many descriptions of
the article which cannot be made, or so well made, by machine,
and supplies a tolerable amount of employment.&nbsp; The French
and Germans now successfully compete with us in the manufacture,
and the export trade to America is decreasing in consequence of
the prohibitory duty imposed by the government of that
country.&nbsp; The nailors, as a class, are almost as destitute
as the colliers of everything like intelligence, and this is
chiefly owing to the early age at which the children work at the
trade and are able to earn a livelihood for themselves.&nbsp; The
truck system&mdash;by which the employer pays the wages of his
workpeople, not in money, but in goods of his own providing, and
at prices of his own fixing&mdash;is an evil of monstrous growth,
which has greatly assisted in the degradation of the
workpeople.&nbsp; Recently, however, many benevolent efforts have
been made to provide them with education and to remedy the social
evils which exist amongst them.&nbsp; Thirty or forty years ago
there was a considerable linen trade carried on at
Bromsgrove.&nbsp; A good deal of flax was once grown in this
neighbourhood, and the manufacture by the hand loom was
considerable, but the introduction of machinery superseded this
mode of making, and enterprise and capital, necessary to the
establishment of factories with the latest improvements in
machinery, were wanting.&nbsp; Moreover Bromsgrove linens got
into disrepute, because those of inferior make were sent here for
bleaching and sold as of Bromsgrove manufacture.&nbsp; Bromsgrove
itself has been much improved within the last twenty years.&nbsp;
In the year 1846 an Act of Parliament was passed for paving,
cleansing, draining, and improving the town, and for the better
assessing and collecting the parochial rates.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Salt Manufacture</span> of Droitwich
is one of the most ancient businesses in the kingdom, having been
carried on for upwards of 1,000 years, and the salt made here has
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>always
been celebrated for its strength and purity.&nbsp; From the year
1805 until 1823 salt was subject to a duty of 15s. a bushel or
&pound;30 a ton, and this impost was collected by the excise
every six weeks.&nbsp; A large capital was therefore required to
carry on the trade, and the price of fine salt was at least
&pound;32 per ton.&nbsp; In that year, however, the duty was
reduced to 2s. a bushel, and in 1825 it was removed altogether;
and the highest price of fine salt, since its repeal, has been
&pound;1. 2s. 6d. per ton.&nbsp; That such a reduction in price
must have led to a greatly increased consumption is self-evident,
but there was no very immediate or considerable increase in the
make.&nbsp; The proprietors of the original salt works in this
borough sought to protect themselves against competition, by
buying up most of the land that would be available for the
erection of new works, and for a time they kept up their
profits.&nbsp; Rival companies, however, did at length find means
of establishing themselves, and about twelve or fourteen years
ago a large increase of production took place, but the price of
the article has been so reduced by this competition that the
business has become very unremunerative.&nbsp; Repeated failures
have taken place amongst the more recent firms; and half a
million of capital, invested in the manufacture within the last
twenty-five years, has been entirely lost.&nbsp; Within the last
fifty years the primitive method of simply boring for the brine
has been improved upon by casing the pit with wood, and more
recently shafts have been sunk quite through the fresh water
springs, the bottom and sides of which are secured with iron
cylinders before boring down to the brine springs.&nbsp; By this
means the brine (which lies 173 feet from the surface) is
obtained at its full saturation of 42 parts of salt to 100, while
formerly it varied between 28 and 37 percent.&nbsp; The present
annual make at Droitwich of all kinds of salt is about 80,000
tons, and at the works at Stoke, from 25,000 to 30,000 tons; the
average price per ton is scarcely more <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>than 10s.&nbsp; The Droitwich trade
labours under considerable disadvantage in the heavy tonnage
which the manufacturers have to pay for the carriage of the
article to the outports, and the iniquitous tax imposed upon the
article in the East Indies, where it is almost a necessary of
life, is a great hindrance to an extension of sale.</p>
<p>The manufactures with which <span
class="smcap">Worcester</span> itself is associated, during the
half-century just closed, have reached their meridian and have
seriously declined.&nbsp; Our porcelain factories were once
almost as famous as those of S&eacute;vres, and notices will be
found in the following pages of continual visits from Royal and
distinguished personages to witness the art of the potter, and to
give large orders for splendid services of China; but this is one
of those articles the demand for which has been greatly affected
by a change of fashion, and plate has now almost wholly
superseded China for dinner services amongst people of
wealth.&nbsp; Truth requires it to be said also that our
manufacturers have allowed themselves to be outstripped, in
spirit and improvement, by those of other places.&nbsp; At the
beginning of this century there were forty or fifty master
glovers in Worcester.&nbsp; The trade received a serious check by
the suspension of our intercourse with America in 1812,
nevertheless, the number had increased in 1826 to 120; but the
repeal of the import duty in that year, together with the more
general use of Berlin and silk gloves, has had such a damaging
effect upon the trade, that there are at present only twenty
master glovers in the city.&nbsp; One firm, however (known as the
Messrs. Dent&rsquo;s), has a world-wide celebrity, and
manufactures on a very large scale.&nbsp; It was not so much in
price as in quality that the Worcester makers had to dread
foreign competition; the article sent out from their workshops
before the repeal of the duty was clumsily and badly made.&nbsp;
Worcester gloves are now equal in every respect to those imported
from France, and are often sold <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>as French to accommodate the
prejudice of the customer.&nbsp; It seems hard to say why
Worcester, a city so centrally situated, and, before the railway
era, so advantageously situated as regards the means of
communication with other parts of the kingdom, has not become a
manufacturing emporium and a place of much greater
importance.&nbsp; In my belief, one principal reason has been the
hindrance to speculative or <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> building,
which exists in the bad tenure of land everywhere around the
city; there can be no doubt that this has driven enterprising men
to settle in places which in other respects were less suitable
for their undertakings.&nbsp; There has, moreover, been a lack of
unity and co&ouml;peration amongst the inhabitants in the
promotion of the general good which has been &ldquo;the worm
i&rsquo; the bud&rdquo; to many schemes which would in all
probability have greatly advanced the prosperity of the
city.&nbsp; Considerations of the common weal have been postponed
to the interests of partizanship.&nbsp; To make an application of
our civic motto&mdash;Worcester, if faithful to herself, may
flourish ever.&nbsp; Worcester is rich in charitable institutions
and revenues for alleviating the distresses of poverty.&nbsp; It
may be a question, indeed, whether these have not reached the
point at which eleemosynary aid ceases to be advantageous, begins
to foster dependence, and eats out the energy of a community; but
their abundance has at any rate not had the effect of drying up
the streams of private benevolence.&nbsp; At least &pound;40,000
have been raised in Worcester at different periods of distress
and necessity which have occurred since 1800, for the relief and
aid of its own poor.</p>
<p>There are many minor manufactures carried on in the county,
especially the preparation of leather at Bewdley, Stourport, and
Worcester, which need not be further particularised, and for the
remaining towns and boroughs&mdash;these&mdash;like an honoured
aristocracy&mdash;repose on their historical associations; the
fame which the touches of a master <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>hand, such as Fielding&rsquo;s, may
have cast around their name; or the remembrances of former
activity and bustle.&nbsp; But I must not omit a passing notice
of <span class="smcap">Malvern</span>, that gem of nature&rsquo;s
setting, on whose hills the purest air is breathed, the purest
water drank, and the richest and most unique inland landscape to
be seen in all England.&nbsp; Formerly what is called Malvern
Wells was the only part of the hills at which visitors stopped,
but for the last twenty years Great Malvern has been gradually
growing as a place of resort, and is now a &ldquo;town&rdquo; by
Act of Parliament.&nbsp; And whether for pleasure or for health
it must continue to be resorted to, and to increase in fame and
importance; for it abounds in nature&rsquo;s simplest but most
efficacious restoratives, and its beauties will bear repeated
inspection, and will be appreciated just in proportion to the
cultivation of the mind that dwells on them.</p>
<p>Even from this hasty and cursory glance at the progress of the
county during the first half of the nineteenth century, it will
be apparent that Worcestershire has not been deficient in
contributing her quota to the general prosperity.&nbsp; The age
is remorseless in its demands; we cannot stand still.&nbsp; The
years that are past press with all their accelerated momentum on
the heels of those that follow and hurry them to a yet greater
speed.&nbsp; But our resources are not exhausted, nor need we
fear that they shall ever be.&nbsp; We do not trace the decay of
nations to any failure in the material of greatness, but in the
enervation of the mind that should develop it.&nbsp; It only
remains for us, then, to be found in the practice of intelligence
and industry&mdash;which make a people great&mdash;and of the
virtues which make a people happy.</p>

20</span>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great change in constituencies
and elections which divides with so marked a line the period over
which the records of this volume extend has long been accepted by
all parties as <i>un fait accompli</i>, and few, if any, would
revert to the system of former days, even if it were
possible.&nbsp; All now see that by its means we have been
enabled to take Reform as our watchword, instead of Revolution,
and to escape anarchy and despotism&mdash;the Scylla and
Charybdis into which the continental nations have been
continually falling.&nbsp; Elections in Worcestershire have of
course been much the same as elections elsewhere; often scenes of
riot and corruption, now and then the occasions of an
irresistible burst of popular feeling, but very far from being at
any time exercises of calm, deliberative, and patriotic
judgment.&nbsp; As to the changes which should be made in the
constituencies with a view to remedy existing evils, and to add
strength to our constitutional edifice, everybody now-a-days has
his own crotchet, and the writer&rsquo;s is an educational
franchise.&nbsp; He believes that it would be perfectly feasible
to make a register of all parties who could read and write, in
the presence of the revising officer, some declaration of the
privileges and responsibilities of a vote, and who could satisfy
him that they understood <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the functions of a
representative.&nbsp; No one that had not so far qualified
himself for the exercise of the franchise could in these days
reasonably complain of being denied it, and it would give a
greater impulse to elementary education than all the grants of
public money that ever have or ever will be made for the
establishment of schools.</p>
<h3>COUNTY OF WORCESTER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the passing of the Reform
Bill the number of electors on the county register was not much
more than 3,500.&nbsp; At the last revision there were in the

<p>1806&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 3&mdash;(Vacancy
occasioned by the elevation of Wm. Lygon, Esq., to the
Peerage.)&mdash;The nomination takes place in the Castle Yard,
Worcester.&nbsp; The Hon. W. B. Lygon, son of the peer recently
created, was proposed by the Rev. Mr. Pyndar, and seconded by
Thomas Hornyold, Esq.&nbsp; The Hon. W. H. Lyttelton, undeterred
by the Beauchamp influence, then thought to be overwhelming, came
forward &ldquo;to assert the independence of the county,&rdquo;
and was proposed by John Amphlett, Esq., of Clent, and seconded
by the Rev. Mr. Onslow, Vicar of Kidderminster.&nbsp; The show of
hands was in favour of Mr. Lygon, and a poll demanded by his
opponent.&nbsp; After five days&rsquo; polling Mr. Lyttelton
resigned, the numbers then being&mdash;Lygon, 1,502; Lyttelton,
1,145&mdash;majority for Lygon, 357.&nbsp; A sharp
correspondence, imputing artifices, fraud, &amp;c., afterwards
took place between the candidates.&nbsp; The representation of
the county had not been contested previously since the general
election of 1741 (64 years before), when the numbers were
Lechmere, 2,309; Pitt, 2,120; Deerhurst, 1,930; Lyttelton,
1,412.</p>

storm came on while the election was proceeding, and the Sheriff
was obliged to retire into the Castle to finish the

as a candidate in his stead.&nbsp; At the nomination, Col. Lygon
was proposed by Sir A. Lechmere, and seconded by Sir William
Smith, Bart.; and Sir Thomas Winnington was proposed by T. S.
Vernon, Esq., and seconded by E. M. Wigley, Esq.&nbsp; There was
no opposition.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;(General
Election.&nbsp; Parliament dissolved by George IV, its possible
sands having almost run out.)&mdash;Col. Lygon and Sir Thomas

<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span>&mdash;(General
Election on the accession of William IV.)&mdash;Sir Thomas
Winnington retired from the representation, and the Hon. Thomas
Henry Foley, son of Lord Foley, was elected in his stead, with
Colonel Lygon, who thus for the fifth time was returned without
opposition.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;(General
Election to take the sense of the country on the Reform
Bill.)&mdash;The Reformers from the first moment that this
election became imminent, looked about for a candidate to oppose
Col. Lygon.&nbsp; First, Mr. Sergeant Russell was mentioned, and
then John Richards, Esq., of Stourbridge.&nbsp; The last named
gentleman actually did one week issue an address to the
freeholders, but, frightened at hearing that the Dowager Lady
Beauchamp had subscribed &pound;50,000 <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>to fight the country, he hastily
withdrew on the next.&nbsp; However, a few days before the
election, Captain Spencer, brother to Lord Althorp, allowed
himself to be named as a candidate, and a tremendous struggle
ensued.&nbsp; Col. Lygon, while canvassing in the Corn Market,
Worcester, was attacked by a town&rsquo;s rabble, and compelled
to take refuge in a neighbouring tavern.&nbsp; On the morning of
the nomination, Col. Lygon assembled his friends at Madresfield;
Mr. Foley at the New Inn, Ombersley Road; and Captain Spencer, at
the Talbot, Tything.&nbsp; The nomination took place in the
Castle Yard, Osman Ricardo, Esq., High Sheriff, being returning
officer.&nbsp; John S. Pakington, Esq., proposed Col. Lygon, who
was seconded by John Phillips, Esq.; T. T. Vernon, Esq.,
proposed, and T. C. Hornyold, Esq., seconded, the Hon. Mr. Foley;
and Sir C. S. Smith, Bart., and Robert Berkeley, Esq., were
Captain Spencer&rsquo;s proposer and seconder.&nbsp; Before the
show of hands was taken, Dr. Beale Cooper demanded proof of
Captain Spencer&rsquo;s qualification, whereupon the Captain said
he had expected such a demand, and handed to the under sheriff a
deed <i>bearing date April</i> 30, purporting to be a grant from
Earl Spencer to Captain Spencer, of a rent charge to the amount
of &pound;600 upon manors and estates in the county of
Herts.&nbsp; The show of hands was declared to be in favour of
Foley and Spencer, whereupon Col. Lygon demanded a poll, which
immediately commenced.&nbsp; Col. Lygon headed the poll the first
day, but never afterwards; and on the morning of the seventh day
he resigned all further contest, the numbers then
being&mdash;Foley, 2,034; Spencer, 1,765; Lygon, 1,335.&nbsp; At
the close of each day speeches were made by the candidates and
their friends, from the booths at the back of the Talbot Inn,
Tything; and the coalition formed between Foley and Spencer, on
finding that Colonel Lygon&rsquo;s friends were plumping for him,
formed a most fertile topic for talk.&nbsp; A riot took place in
Broad Street one evening, in consequence of one of Col.
Lygon&rsquo;s friends having imprudently irritated the mob by
throwing a decanter amongst them from the committee-room.&nbsp;
The windows of the room were immediately broken, and other
disturbances took place.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the
result of this election had great effect upon the country
generally.</p>
<p>A dinner was given in the next week to the Hon. Mr. Foley and
Captain Spencer, at the Bell Inn, with Sir Thomas Winnington,
Bart., in the chair.&nbsp; Sir C. S. Smith was in the vice-chair,
and Lord Lyttelton and about 100 other gentlemen were
present.&nbsp; Dinners were also given to the successful
candidates at Hagley, Kidderminster, Evesham, Stourbridge,
Dudley, and Birmingham.&nbsp; The Birmingham <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>dinner was
held at Dee&rsquo;s Hotel, with Dr. Edward Johnstone in the
chair.</p>
<p>Immediately after the election a meeting of Col. Lygon&rsquo;s
friends was held at the Hoppole, Worcester, &ldquo;to take into
consideration the best mode of testifying their approbation of
his manly, spirited, and patriotic conduct upon the late
election; and for his faithful services during the fifteen years
he represented this county in Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; J. S.
Pakington, Esq., was called to the chair, and there was a very
respectable attendance.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington asserted that the
minority who had voted for the Colonel, comprised the majority of
the education and respectability of the county.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;discreditable coalition&rdquo; proved the theme of much
lamentation.&nbsp; Resolutions approving of Col. Lygon&rsquo;s
Parliamentary career and general conduct were agreed to, and a
subscription entered into for the purchase of plate.&nbsp; This
was presented at a dinner at the Hoppole, in February,
1832.&nbsp; It was a superb vase, 57 inches in circumference,
supported on a massive column and plinth, decorated with embossed
Acanthus leaves, and weighing in the whole 600 oz.&nbsp; It was
designed by the inscription to be &ldquo;a testimony of the
gratitude of his political friends for his long and faithful
attention to their interest in Parliament, and especially for his
support of our glorious and long cherished
constitution.&rdquo;&nbsp; John S. Pakington, Esq., was the
president of the evening, and presented the testimonial.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;(Election
rendered necessary by the passing of the Reform Bill.)&mdash;The
county now divided into two divisions.&mdash;<i>West
Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;The Hon. T. H. Foley (Whig), and Col.
Lygon (Conservative), returned without opposition.&nbsp; The
nomination took place in the space fronting the County Gaol, and
the candidates were not proposed or seconded, the cries of
&ldquo;Foley and Lygon&rdquo; by the crowd, without any other
person being named, being taken by the Sheriff as sufficient.</p>
<p><i>East Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;The nomination of candidates
took place at Droitwich, Mr. Pakington (Conservative), being
proposed by James Taylor, Esq., and John Phillips, Esq., of
Hanbury Hall; Thomas Henry Cookes, Esq., (Whig) by Sir Thomas
Winnington, Bart., and C. E. Hanford, Esq.; and Wm. Congreve
Russell, Esq., (Whig) by T. T. Vernon, Esq., and W. Acton,
Esq.&nbsp; The High Sheriff declared the show of hands to be in
favour of Mr. Pakington and Mr. Cookes, whereupon a poll was
demanded for Mr. Russell.&nbsp; After the two days&rsquo; poll
the numbers were declared to be&mdash;Russell, 2,576; Cookes,
2,516; Pakington, 1,916.&nbsp; The whole proceedings were
conducted in a peaceable and gentlemanly manner, and Mr.
Pakington, who addressed <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the electors at the
&ldquo;Declaration,&rdquo; as well as the successful candidates,
was very well received.&nbsp; He complained of broken promises,
and the coalition of his opponents as fettering the
&ldquo;independence&rdquo; of the county, but declared himself
neither disheartened nor offended.</p>
<p>1833&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;<i>West
Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;(Vacancy occasioned by the elevation of
the Hon. T. H. Foley to the House of Peers, on the death of his
father.)&mdash;The nomination took place in the field at the back
of the Talbot Inn, Tything.&nbsp; Sir Christopher Smith, Bart.,
proposed Captain H. J. Winnington, who was seconded by Robert
Berkeley, Esq.&nbsp; John Williams, Esq., and T. C. Brock, Esq.,
proposed and seconded John S. Pakington, Esq., who, to the great
detriment of his cause, was not present during any part of the
proceedings&mdash;having just previously sailed to America.&nbsp;
Major Bund spoke at the hustings on his behalf.&nbsp; A Mr.
Crowther also made many attempts to be heard, but was hissed
down, and he afterwards explained in a letter to the newspapers
that instead of being Mr. Pakington&rsquo;s opponent, as
formerly, he intended to be his supporter, because Captain
Winnington and the Whigs had voted for the erection of the New
County Courts, while Mr. Pakington, on the contrary, &ldquo;had
always opposed that unnecessary and shameful expenditure of the
freeholders&rsquo; money.&rdquo;&nbsp; The show of hands was very
decidedly in favour of Captain Winnington, and the Court was
declared adjourned (from the Wednesday) to the following
Monday.&nbsp; At the end of the first day&rsquo;s poll Captain
Winnington was 79 a-head, and the utmost excitement
prevailed.&nbsp; Lord Eastnor addressed the multitude on Mr.
Pakington&rsquo;s behalf, and the Rev. Thomas Pearson spoke for
Captain Winnington.&nbsp; The second day only increased Captain
Winnington&rsquo;s majority, but the result was not certainly
known till the declaration of the numbers by the High Sheriff, on
Thursday morning, when they were announced to be&mdash;for
Captain Winnington, 1,369; for Pakington, 1,278: majority for
Winnington, 91.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington had a majority in the
Worcester and Upton divisions, but was beaten in those of
Stourport and Tenbury.&nbsp; Out of 3,122 voters, 2,647 were
polled, and though there had never been so close a contest in the
county before, it was carried on with very good humour.&nbsp;
Captain Winnington&rsquo;s return was celebrated by a dinner at
the Star and Garter Hotel, with Sir C. S. Smith in the chair.</p>

the Grey and Spencer cabinet, and the accession of the Duke of
Wellington and Sir R. Peel to power.)&mdash;Mr. Russell retired
from the representation at this election, on the score of
ill-health, and his place was taken on the Reform interest by
Edward Holland, Esq., <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of Dumbleton.&nbsp; Mr. Horace St.
Paul was brought forward late in the day by the
Conservatives.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Winnington, M.P., and C. E.
Hanford, Esq., proposed Mr. Cookes, the former member.&nbsp;
James Taylor, Esq., of Moseley Hall, and Mr. Whitmore Jones,
proposed Mr. St. Paul; and Mr. Bate, of Stourbridge, and Mr.
Acton, Mr. Edward Holland.&nbsp; The choice of the people at the
nomination was declared to have fallen on Messrs. Cookes and
Holland, and a poll was demanded for Mr. St. Paul.&nbsp; At the
end of the two days&rsquo; poll the numbers were&mdash;Holland,
2,254; Cookes, 2,192; St. Paul, 2,145.&nbsp; Majority of Cookes
over St. Paul, 47.&nbsp; 4,125 persons voted out of 5,226 on the
register.&nbsp; There was some rioting at Stourbridge, which
necessitated the sending for two troops of lancers from
Birmingham, and Mr. St. Paul, declaring that some of his voters
had been prevented from coming to the poll by violence, presented
a protest against the election.&nbsp; A petition was talked of on
this ground, but it came to nothing.&nbsp; A dinner was given to
the successful candidates, at the Golden Cross Hotel, Bromsgrove,
at which Colonel Davies presided.&nbsp; A similar dinner at
Stourbridge, with J. H. H. Foley, Esq., in the chair, gave rise
to a correspondence between Messrs. Robins, Hickman, Hodgetts,
and Trow, and Mr. Robert Scott and Lord Lyttelton.&nbsp; The
first named gentlemen chose to believe that some remarks made by
Mr. Scott on the partiality and incompetency of the county
magistracy generally, were intended for themselves, and they
appealed to Lord Lyttelton to institute an inquiry.&nbsp; The
Lord Lieutenant not only refused to accede to their request, but
rebuked them for the language they had used.</p>
<p><i>West Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;The candidates were as
before, Colonel Lygon and Mr. Pakington, who professed to
coalesce on the Conservative interest, and Captain Winnington,
Whig.&nbsp; Sir A. Lechmere and the Hon. W. Coventry proposed
Col. Lygon; Mr. Osman Ricardo and Mr. Berkeley, Captain
Winnington; and Lord Eastnor and Mr. T. C. Brock, Mr.
Pakington.&nbsp; The show of hands was declared to be in favour
of Captain Winnington and Mr. Pakington.&nbsp; At the close of
the poll the numbers were&mdash;Lygon, 1,945; Winnington, 1,938;
Pakington, 1,773: majority for Winnington, 165.&nbsp; 3,619
persons voted out of 4,126 upon the register.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election on the death of William IV.)&mdash;<i>West
Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;General Lygon and Captain Winnington
re&euml;lected without opposition.</p>
<p><i>East Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;Here there was a fierce
contest, ending in the return, for the first time, of two
Conservatives.&nbsp; Before the election took place the
Conservatives offered a compromise, and <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>suggested
that one of each party should be allowed to walk over, but the
Liberals were so sanguine of winning that they would not listen
to the proposal.&nbsp; Mr. Cookes had retired from the
representation from ill-health, but his place was supplied by Mr.
J. H. H. Foley, who, with Mr. Holland, came forward in the
Liberal interest, while the Conservative candidates were Mr. H.
St. Paul and Mr. Barneby.&nbsp; On the hustings Colonel Davies
and Sir William Rouse Boughton, Bart., proposed Mr. Holland; T.
H. Cookes, Esq., (the late member) and James Foster, Esq., Mr.
Foley; James Taylor, Esq., and Thomas Hawkes, Esq., M.P., Mr. H.
St. Paul; and Lord Eastnor and Edward Dixon, Esq., Mr.
Barneby.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of Messrs. Barneby
and St. Paul; and after the two days&rsquo; poll they were
declared duly elected; the numbers being&mdash;St. Paul, 2,595;
Barneby, 2,528; Holland, 2,175; Foley, 2,168.&nbsp; In the
Stourbridge, Bromsgrove, and Evesham districts only, had the
Liberal candidates a slight majority.&nbsp; Mr. Horace St.
Paul&rsquo;s expenses at this election are said to have been
&pound;16,000.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;(General
Election.&nbsp; The Parliament having declared their want of
confidence in the ministers, the Whigs appeal to the people on
the Corn Law, Sugar, and Irish Registration questions.&nbsp; Sir

carried by a majority of one against ministers.)&mdash;<i>West
Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;General Lygon and F. Winn Knight, Esq.,
nephew of the late John Knight, Esq., of Downton Castle, were
elected without opposition.&nbsp; Captain Winnington had retired
from the field in consequence of the division amongst his
supporters on the Corn Law question.&nbsp; He had constantly
voted against any alteration of the Corn Laws, and therefore did
not please the constituencies of the towns.&nbsp; With this state
of things, added to the loss of the Foley interest in the county,
he could have had no chance, and therefore refused to disturb the
division by a contest.</p>
<p><i>East Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;John Barneby, Esq., and
James Arthur Taylor, Esq., returned.&nbsp; Mr. Horace St. Paul
retired from the representation because of ill-health, and for
the same reason Mr. Holland declined to offer on the Liberal
interest.&nbsp; The Hon. Captain St. George Foley, brother of
Lord Foley, offered himself to the electors as an advocate of
Liberal measures, and of a moderate fixed duty upon corn.&nbsp;
At the nomination at Droitwich, Mr. Barneby was proposed by J. S.
Pakington, Esq., M.P., and W. Hemming, Esq.; Captain Foley, by
James Foster, Esq., and Robert Scott, Esq.&nbsp; M.P., in long
and able speeches; and Mr. Taylor, by C. Noel, Esq., and Whitmore
Jones, Esq.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of Barneby and
Taylor, <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>and Captain Foley&rsquo;s friends demanded a poll.&nbsp;
At a meeting, however, which was held at Mr. Galton&rsquo;s,
shortly after nomination, it was decided, much to Captain
Foley&rsquo;s own mortification, not to proceed to a poll, and
that determination was communicated the same evening to the
opposite party.&nbsp; The Sheriff at first thought that he should
be obliged to take a poll, under the circumstances,
notwithstanding, and the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion was
taken upon the point, but this being in favour of the propriety
of dispensing with the poll, Messrs. Barneby and Taylor were
declared duly elected without further trouble.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;<i>East
Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;(Election to supply the vacancy caused
by the decease of John Barneby, Esq.)&mdash;Captain Rushout was
the first candidate announced, but J. H. H. Foley, Esq., having
intimated his intention of contesting the division, a meeting of
the Conservative party was called at Droitwich, at which an
arrangement was entered into, by which Mr. Foley retired from the
field at present, and was to be permitted to come in unopposed at
the next election, when it was expected that a vacancy would be
caused by the retirement of Mr. James Arthur Taylor.&nbsp; This
created a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the Conservative
electors, but the contracting parties were too influential to
admit of their decision being contravened.&nbsp; Captain Rushout
was, therefore, on this occasion elected without opposition.</p>

Captain Rushout was returned unopposed.</p>
<p><i>West Worcestershire</i>.&mdash;General Lygon and Mr. Knight
were returned without opposition.</p>
<h3>CITY OF WORCESTER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> constituency of the city is no
larger now than it was in days of yore, when freemen were made in
any quantity at the pleasure of the corporation; often while the
election was proceeding.&nbsp; The number of voters now on the
register <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>is about 2,200; of these, 1,099 still qualify as
freemen, and nearly 700 have no other qualification.</p>
<p>1802&mdash;(General Election)&mdash;The electors having been
convened together in the Guildhall for the nomination in the
usual manner, the Mayor (Mr. Rowlands) proposed the
re&euml;lection of Edward Wigley and Abraham Robarts, Esqs., the
previous members.&nbsp; This proposition was seconded, and the
business of the day went on most smoothly until within seven
minutes of the hour at which the writ was made returnable, when
the hall became suddenly and most violently agitated by the
arrival of Joseph Scott, Esq., of Great Barr, a relative of Lord
Dudley and Ward, who came forward and declared himself a
candidate, as he said, in compliance with the wishes of a number
of the inhabitants.&nbsp; A poll was demanded on his behalf,
which immediately commenced, and continued for four days; at the
end of which, the numbers were&mdash;Robarts, 2,163; Scott,
1,197; Wigley, 1,180.&nbsp; On the fifth morning Mr. Wigley
retired, and Robarts and Scott were declared duly elected.&nbsp;
There was no disturbance.&nbsp; Politics seem to have entered
very little into consideration, and the matter to have been
decided by person and purse.&nbsp; Mr. Wigley, in his retiring
address to the &ldquo;Worthy Freemen of the City of
Worcester,&rdquo; intimated that he had come forward thirteen
years before, at their own request, to rescue their city from
becoming a Government nomination borough, and he did not see why
he should now have been rejected.&nbsp; To those &ldquo;who
promised him their support, but voted for his opponent, he had
nothing to say, because he could say nothing that would be
pleasing to himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; A meeting of his friends and
supporters was afterwards held at the Crown Inn, Henry Wakeman,
Esq., presiding, at which resolutions were passed thanking Mr.
Wigley for his conduct in Parliament, and his great attention to
the interests of this city, where he and others of his family had
resided for more than thirty years, and &ldquo;been an example,
rarely exceeded, of piety, benevolence, and charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1806&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Candidates, Abrm. Robarts, Esq., the former
member; Colonel Bromley, of Abberley Lodge; and William Gordon,
Esq., who rested his claims to support on the fact of his being a
mercantile man, and, as such, better fitted to represent the city
of Worcester than Colonel Bromley, a country gentleman.&nbsp; He
was supported by gentlemen who were disgusted by the unblushing
bribery of previous elections.&nbsp; After three days&rsquo;
polling, Mr. Gordon retired, the numbers being&mdash;Robarts,
856; Bromley, 563; Gordon, 348: total number of freemen polled,
902.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon was afterwards <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span><i>f&ecirc;ted</i> at the Crown
Hotel, on which occasion he attributed his defeat to his being so
late in the field.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon, however, afterwards
presented a petition against Colonel Bromley&rsquo;s return,
which that gentleman declined to defend, and accepted the
Chiltern Hundreds, so that the seat again became vacant.</p>
<p>1807&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 13&mdash;At the
election thus rendered necessary, Alderman Squires proposed
William Gordon, Esq., and Alderman Carden, John Attersoll, Esq.,
both gentlemen being London merchants.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon declared
himself to be a staunch Church and King man, and utterly opposed
to the continuance of the Slave Trade.&nbsp; Mr. Attersoll talked
a little more about civil and religious freedom.&nbsp; There
seems to have been no show of hands taken, and both parties
required a poll, which was commenced amidst a great deal of
fighting and outrage.&nbsp; After three days&rsquo; polling Mr.
Attersoll retired, the numbers being&mdash;Gordon, 766;
Attersoll, 414: majority for Gordon, 352.&nbsp; A petition was
next presented against Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s return, on the score of
bribery, by several inhabitants of the city.&nbsp; A meeting was
held at the Crown, to take steps to counteract this petition, Mr.
J. Palmer in the chair.&nbsp; Mr. Hebb moved the resolutions, in
a speech which the reporter of the time says &ldquo;displayed
great constitutional knowledge and erudition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
petition was dismissed in consequence of the necessary
recognizances not being entered into.</p>
<p>1807&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 6&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Mr. Robarts and Mr. Gordon returned without
opposition.&nbsp; Mr. Attersoll having canvassed the electors,
and found that he had no chance, retired on the eve of the
contest.</p>
<p>This election was chiefly remarkable for the quantity of pens
and ink wasted upon it.&nbsp; Mr. Gordon, after being returned as
an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; member, followed the example of most
of his contemporary M.P.&rsquo;s, in turning his position to
account, and obtained from the Government a license to trade with
Spain.&nbsp; He was warned of the consequences of becoming a tool
of Government by Mr. Hebb, in a series of letters bearing the
signature of Cato Uticensis.&nbsp; Then followed various blasts
and counter-blasts, especially a sheet of rhyme called the
<i>Doctoriad</i>, to which there was a smart replication under
the title of the <i>Gordonian</i>; and these were for some time
the <i>poemes cel&eacute;bres</i> of Worcester elections.</p>
<p>1812&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 5&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Mr. Robarts and Mr. Gordon again candidates,
though, as the latter was out of the country, he was represented
by his father-in-law, Sir George Cornewall.&nbsp; A day or two
before the election, a number of freemen <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>presented a
requisition to Lord Deerhurst, pressing him to offer himself,
which he did.&nbsp; At the nomination, Mr. Robarts and Lord
Deerhurst obtained the show of hands, and a poll was demanded on
behalf of Mr. Gordon.&nbsp; After eight days&rsquo;
contest&mdash;severer than any which had taken place in the city
since the celebrated one in 1761, between Sir William Watkin
Lewes and Mr. Rouse&mdash;the numbers were found to
be&mdash;Robarts, 1,248; Gordon, 939; Deerhurst, 855.&nbsp; Lord
Deerhurst then retired, having won golden opinions from all sorts
of men, by the eloquence of his speeches, the courtesy of his
manner, and the good humour he had maintained.&nbsp; He polled a
majority of the resident freemen, but was beaten by the
out-voters.&nbsp; The number of freemen polled at this election
was 1,765.&nbsp; No particular political principle seems to have
been at all involved in the contest.&nbsp; A gold cup was
afterwards purchased by Lord Deerhurst&rsquo;s supporters, and
presented to him at a dinner at the Crown; Thomas Farley, Esq.,
in the chair.</p>
<p>1816&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;(Vacancy
on the death of A. Robarts, Esq.)&mdash;Lord Deerhurst again
offered himself as a candidate, and Colonel Davies made his first
appearance in Worcester.&nbsp; He continued an active canvass for
some time, but at last finding that Lord Deerhurst had
indubitably secured a majority of votes, he withdrew.&nbsp; Lord
Deerhurst was proposed at the hustings by the Mayor (R.
Chamberlain, Esq.), and seconded by E. M. Wigley, Esq.&nbsp; The
chairing took place immediately afterwards, and the chair itself
was very prematurely demolished by the mob in High Street.&nbsp;
On the following day a grand dinner was given to the new member
at the Hoppole.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 15&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;This was one of the severest contested elections
which had been known in the city of Worcester, and it terminated
in the return of Colonel Davies to Parliament for the first
time.&nbsp; The city had been kept in great excitement for some
months before the election, by the continued canvassing of all
the candidates.&nbsp; All parties were enthusiastic in their
support of Lord Deerhurst, whose return was safe from the first,
and the contest lay between Sir William Duff Gordon and Colonel
Davies.&nbsp; Sir William Gordon had forfeited some of his
popularity by the course he had taken in voting with Government,
for the orders in council altering the import duties, and which
were supposed to have had a great effect upon the glove
trade.&nbsp; Colonel Davies, shortly before the election, gave up
his commission in the Guards, that he might make the better
Member of Parliament, by having his time entirely
unfettered.&nbsp; Though not much was <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>said about political principles in
the addresses of the different candidates, it was understood that
Colonel Davies was more Whiggish in his views than either of the
other men.&nbsp; Tumults took place both at Kidderminster and in
London amongst the out-voters, who were canvassed there by the
different parties, and at the polling places the riot and
disturbance was worse than ever before recollected.&nbsp; At the
nomination, Lord Deerhurst was proposed by the Mayor (S. Wall,
Esq.), and seconded by Mr. John Dent.&nbsp; Sir William Gordon
was proposed by Major Bund and Mr. Thomas Dent; and Colonel
Davies by Alderman Nash and Mr. Richards.&nbsp; After seven
days&rsquo; polling, Sir William Gordon withdrew from the
contest; the numbers then being&mdash;Deerhurst, 1,422; Davies,
1,024; Gordon, 874.&nbsp; Colonel Davies had a majority both in
the city and out-votes; but he was principally the gainer among
the London freemen.&nbsp; The total number polled was
1,963.&nbsp; The two members were chaired as usual the day after
the election had concluded, and the chairs demolished by the
populace, according to their ancient prerogative and right.</p>
<p>Petitions were presented against both Colonel Davies&rsquo;s
and Lord Deerhurst&rsquo;s return.&nbsp; The latter, however, was
withdrawn.&nbsp; On the 16th March, 1819, the committee to
investigate Colonel Davies&rsquo;s return was ballotted for, and
Mr. Alexander Baring, M.P. for Taunton, chosen chairman.&nbsp;
The petition alleged bribery and treating, but the necessary
witnesses were kept out of the way.&nbsp; Colonel Davies was
declared duly elected by the casting vote of the chairman, and
the news was received in Worcester with great rejoicings by his
supporters.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Lord Deerhurst and Colonel Davies returned
without opposition: the former being proposed by Thomas Carden,
Esq., and seconded by Samuel Crane, Esq.; and the latter, by
Richard Nash, Esq., seconded by E. M. Wigley, Esq.&nbsp; The
chairing, on this occasion, was a very splendid affair.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;So long before this election as March, 1824,
George Richard Robinson, Esq., a London merchant, announced his
intention of becoming a candidate on &ldquo;independent&rdquo;
principles, and by a free expenditure of money made himself
popular.&nbsp; All parties had been engaged in a very active
canvass, but in May Lord Deerhurst suddenly announced his
determination not again to offer himself as a candidate.&nbsp;
This caused immense chagrin, not only to his pledged supporters,
who said his victory was certain, but also to all those who had
revelled in the prospect of the high price which votes would
fetch in a prolonged and doubtful contest&mdash;such as the
forthcoming one promised to be.&nbsp; Lord Deerhurst made <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>his
appointment as a Vice Lieutenant, and his other numerous public
duties, the plea for retiring.&nbsp; Richard Griffiths, Esq., of
Thorngrove, was induced to come forward in his stead at the
eleventh hour.&nbsp; On the hustings, Colonel Davies was proposed
by Mr. Alderman Carden and Mr. John Palmer; Mr. G. R. Robinson,
by Mr. Alderman Ballard and Major Bund; and Mr. Griffiths, by Mr.
John Dent and Mr. Henry Clifton.&nbsp; Colonel Davies avowed
himself in favour of reform, economy, and free trade; Mr.
Robinson intended generally to support ministers, but declared
himself independent; and Mr. Griffiths was a thorough Church and
King man.&nbsp; After six days&rsquo; poll the numbers
were&mdash;Robinson, 1,542; Davies, 1,268; and Griffiths,
1,036.&nbsp; Mr. Griffiths then withdrew from the contest, having
spent, during the week he was in the city, some &pound;8,000, and
thus answered the chief end of the parties who dragged him
forward.&nbsp; There indeed was scarcely ever such a dear
election, to all the candidates, in the city of
Worcester&mdash;the most unprecedented exertions in fetching
voters from a distance, &amp;c., being made.&nbsp; The entire sum
spent is said to have been &pound;25,000.&nbsp; The total number
of freemen polled was 1,963&mdash;viz., 1,184, city; 246, from
London; and 433, country.&nbsp; This was the largest number on
record as having polled at any election.&nbsp; Davies had 322
plumpers; Robinson, 132; and Griffiths, 50.&nbsp; The chairing
took place as usual, and the elegant cars were broken to pieces
at the bottom of Broad Street, at the imminent risk of the new
members&rsquo; lives.&nbsp; A dinner was given in the succeeding
week to Mr. Robinson, at the Hoppole, Mr. Alderman Ballard
presiding.&nbsp; Colonel Davies&rsquo;s friends met to form a
committee to secure his return in future at less expense; and Mr.
Griffiths announced his firm intention of offering himself again,
whenever a vacancy should occur.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 30&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Colonel Davies and Mr. Robinson returned without
opposition; all the efforts of the third-man-no-matter-who party
having failed to produce a candidate.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;The Tory party three days before the election
brought forward a candidate in the person of the Hon. Colonel
Henry Fitzroy, brother to Lord Southampton, but the Reform
enthusiasm was so strong that his voice was drowned in the
disapprobation of the people the moment he opened his lips, and
all the significant hints that he had plenty of money to spend
were thrown away.&nbsp; The Colonel soon found that he was in a
false position, and did not appear on the hustings at the day of
nomination.&nbsp; Colonel Davies was proposed by George Farley,
Esq., and seconded by Mr. John <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Palmer; while Archibald Cameron,
Esq., proposed, and Thomas Scott, Esq., seconded, Mr.
Robinson.&nbsp; They were declared duly elected, and the chairing
took place forthwith, but the chair was demolished sooner than
usual.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Colonel Davies and Mr. Robinson again
returned.&nbsp; A few weeks before the election a third candidate
appeared on the scene, in the person of R. A. Dundas, Esq.,
cousin of Viscount Melville, intending to contest the city on
Conservative principles, but after a canvass he gave the matter
up as hopeless.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson having in an address to the
electors, said that Mr. Dundas had been &ldquo;deluded with hopes
of success, which proved utterly fallacious&rdquo;&mdash;his
supporters sent for him back again, and declared that he should
stand a poll unless Mr. Robinson withdrew these
&ldquo;offensive&rdquo; expressions.&nbsp; A long conference took
place, and some modification of the terms, or explanation of
their intention, was conceded, and Mr. Dundas once more made his
bow.&nbsp; Colonel Davies was proposed by Mr. Hebb and Mr. George
Allen; and Mr. Robinson by Mr. Spooner and Mr. Munn.&nbsp; The
members went through the city in an open carriage drawn by six
grey horses, instead of in a chair, and the mob having shewn some
disposition to destroy the carriage, they were disappointed by
the postillions turning suddenly along the back streets into the
Hoppole yard.&nbsp; Some of the crowd climbed the gates, and
began to tear the decorations, but they were beaten off.&nbsp; A
dinner was afterwards given to the two members unitedly, at the
Bell Inn, Mr. Hebb in the chair.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;On this occasion a
candidate was brought forward by the Conservatives in the person
of Joseph Bailey, Esq., a very opulent ironmaster from Glanusk,
in Monmouthshire.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson appeared to be an universal
favourite, as by the comparative moderation of his views he had
conciliated many of the Tory party, but they concentrated all
their animosity against Colonel Davies, who had not only been a
very determined but very active promoter of Reform measures in
the House of Commons.&nbsp; The Colonel had lost favour with some
of the glovers by his support of free trade principles.&nbsp; The
most strenuous exertions were made by the Colonel and Mr. Bailey,
between whom it was at once seen that the struggle would lie,
while Mr. Robinson rested upon his oars in security.&nbsp; At the
nomination, Mr. Hebb and Mr. Allies proposed Colonel Davies; Dr.
Hastings and Mr. Thomas Scott, proposed Mr. Robinson; and Mr.
John Williams, of Pitmaston, and Mr. Dent, proposed Mr.
Bailey.&nbsp; The show of hands was entirely in favour of the two
old members, and <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>a poll was demanded by Mr. Gutch in favour of Mr.
Bailey.&nbsp; At the end of the first day&rsquo;s poll the
numbers were&mdash;Robinson, 1,309; Davies, 882; Bailey, 835; but
the second day altered the state of things, and the final return,
as made by the Sheriff, was&mdash;Robinson, 1,611; Bailey, 1,154;
Davies, 1,137: majority for Bailey, 17.&nbsp; There was a sharp
affray between the street partizans of the various candidates on
Tuesday evening, and several heads were broken.&nbsp; Immediately
after the election a dinner was given to Colonel Davies and Mr.
Robinson, at the Bell Inn, W. Sanders, Esq., in the chair; at
which it was announced to be the intention of Colonel
Davies&rsquo;s friends to bring the result of the election before
a committee of the House of Commons.&nbsp; Captain Winnington,
Mr. Cookes, and Mr. Holland, the three recently elected Whig
members for the county, were present.&nbsp; A dinner was given to
Joseph Bailey, Esq., M.P., at the Hoppole, in February.&nbsp; The
party numbered nearly 200, and Mr. Richard Spooner was in the
chair.&nbsp; The various speakers boasted of the
&ldquo;reaction&rdquo; which had taken place in favour of
Conservative principles.&nbsp; Mr. Bailey paid his first visit to
Worcester after his election in October; dinners were provided
for his supporters, and <i>eighty public houses</i> were
&ldquo;opened&rdquo; in the evening.&nbsp; The principal party
was given at the Unicorn Inn, Broad Street, where Mr. Richard
Spooner presided.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Clifton and Mr. Pierpoint were
vice-chairmen.</p>
<p>As soon as the session opened, a petition was presented
against Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s return, and a scrutiny of votes took
place before a committee of the House of Commons, which was
ballotted for March 31st, and consisted of seven Tories and four
Whigs; Mr. J. E. Denison (Nottinghamshire) being chairman.&nbsp;
After a sitting of eleven days, fifty-five votes were struck off
by the petitioners, and forty by Mr. Bailey, still leaving that
gentleman in a majority of one; and the petitioners then gave up
the struggle, in consequence of several adverse decisions on the
part of the committee.&nbsp; The following is a summary of the
votes struck off on each side:</p>

<p>The petitioners alleged three cases of bribery on Mr.
Bailey&rsquo;s part, <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>but failed in the proof; and the
votes of a number of Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s professional agents,
objected to by the petitioners, were retained, in consequence of
the memorable evidence of one of their number&mdash;that their
services were all gratuitously rendered.&nbsp; The conduct of the
petition was intrusted to Mr. John Hill, and by him managed most
admirably.&nbsp; The expenses were all covered by the
subscriptions, which had been previously raised, and that almost
entirely among the citizens themselves.&nbsp; Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s
expenses are said to have been &pound;16,000.&nbsp; The expenses
of the election itself were but trifling.&nbsp; Of course the
greatest excitement prevailed in the city during the progress of
the petition, and Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s party had great rejoicings
on the issue.</p>
<p>In September, 1836, a dinner was given by the Worcester
Conservative operatives to Mr. Bailey, at the Theatre.&nbsp; 427
persons sat down to table, and there were many spectators.&nbsp;
The chief speakers were Mr. Bailey, Mr. Spooner, Mr. Pakington,
and Mr. John Dent.&nbsp; There were great congratulations on the
&ldquo;reaction&rdquo; which had taken place in the city, as
elsewhere, in favour of Toryism.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards (October 24) the operative Reformers
got up a great dinner in the Town Hall, to refute the cry about
&ldquo;reaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eight hundred persons sat down to
dinner in the outer hall, 500 in the assembly room, and others at
different inns.&nbsp; Mr. Arrowsmith was in the chair; supported
on his right by the Mayor, and on the left by Colonel
Davies.&nbsp; The whole party met in the outer hall after dinner
(this being brilliantly lighted up for the occasion), and a
number of appropriate toasts were given.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;The candidates at this
election were Mr. Bailey and Mr. Robinson (the former members),
and Colonel Davies; but on the day of nomination Mr. Robinson
retired in the most unexpected manner.&nbsp; This was owing to
many of the Liberal electors having refused to give him their
promises on his canvass, because they thought he had not behaved
well to Colonel Davies at the previous election, and had,
moreover, offended them by some votes in the House, which did not
savour sufficiently of party.&nbsp; Mr. Bailey and Colonel Davies
were declared duly elected, under protest from Mr. J. D.
Stevenson, who had proposed (but a little too late) Mr. James
Morison, of London.</p>
<p>Mr. John Hood and Mr. Joseph Lingham proposed Mr. Robinson on
this occasion; Mr. John Williams and Mr. John Dent, Mr. Bailey;
the Mayor and Mr. George Allies, Colonel Davies.</p>
<p>Barristers&rsquo; opinions were afterwards obtained, declaring
that the <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>return of the Sheriff was, under the circumstances,
incorrect.&nbsp; In anticipation of another election, therefore,
a Mr. Turton, son of Sir Thomas Turton, a Sussex baronet, was
introduced to the electors as a candidate on the Liberal
interest.&nbsp; He addressed a public meeting in the Guildhall in
October, at which it was resolved&mdash;first, to petition; and,
secondly, to support Mr. Turton if a vacancy then occurred.&nbsp;
Colonel Davies&rsquo;s friends refused to promise a coalition
with Mr. Turton.&nbsp; At the eleventh hour the petition was
abandoned, and Mr. Bailey brought an action against the
petitioners to recover &pound;174, the sum which he had expended
in preparing to defend his seat; but on an appearance being put
in, the claim was abandoned.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Colonel Davies retiring from the representation,
because of ill-health, was succeeded by Sir Thomas Wilde, who,
during his candidateship for the city, was made Attorney General,
in the room of Sir John Campbell, elevated to the Irish
Chancellorship.&nbsp; Mr. Bailey again offered himself on the
Conservative interest, and Mr. Robert Hardy, of the firm of Hardy
and Padmore, ironfounders, being determined that the Tories
should not have the seat uncontested, presented himself as the
candidate of the Radical party, of which he had long been a
leading member.&nbsp; Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s personal character and
liberality had caused him to be greatly respected in the city;
but his ultra opinions, and especially the fact of his being a
Dissenter, left him little chance of success.&nbsp; The usual
meetings took place before the election, and Sir Thomas Wilde
availed himself of the opportunity to make some most able
speeches in exposition and defence of the policy of the
ministry.&nbsp; The nomination in the Guildhall presented more
than the usual scene of confusion, and a fight with bludgeons
took place in the midst of it, which had well-nigh proved fatal
to one young man, who was accidentally struck on the head.&nbsp;
Mr. Bailey was proposed by Mr. John Dent and Mr. Pierpoint; Sir
Thomas Wilde, by Mr. George Farley and Alderman Corles; and Mr.
Hardy, by Mr. Edward Lloyd and Mr. Ledbrook.&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Wilde and Mr. Hardy had a great majority on the show of hands,
and a poll was demanded by Mr. Bailey.&nbsp; The numbers, as
declared by the Sheriff, were&mdash;Wilde, 1,187; Bailey, 1,173;
Hardy, 875.&nbsp; All parties were surprised to find that Mr.
Hardy had obtained so many votes.</p>
<p>The supporters of Mr. Hardy afterwards presented him with a
large silver salver &ldquo;for his generous and patriotic conduct
in coming forward to vindicate, by his example, purity of
election, and to afford his fellow citizens an opportunity of
redeeming their opinions from misrepresentation by a
Tory.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>1846&mdash;<span
class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(Election caused by Sir Thomas
Wilde taking office under the new Whig ministry.)&mdash;Sir
Thomas Wilde having been appointed Attorney General, he came to
Worcester to be re&euml;lected by his constituency, and on the
Monday (July 6) he addressed his supporters in the large room of
the Bell Hotel.&nbsp; They unanimously agreed to renew their
adhesion, and no other candidate was thought of.&nbsp; The
election was fixed for Wednesday, but on Tuesday evening Sir
Thomas was apprised by Lord John Russell of the sudden decease of
Sir Nicholas Tindal, and of the intention to elevate Sir Thomas
to the chief justiceship of the Common Pleas.&nbsp; Of course,
under these circumstances, Sir Thomas could no longer be member
for Worcester, but Government had taken care to provide a
candidate in the bearer of the message, Sir Denis Le Marchant,
Bart., now chief clerk of the House of Commons.&nbsp; The Liberal
party were hastily summoned together on Wednesday morning, and on
the recommendation of their late representative, they transferred
their support from Sir Thomas to Sir Denis.&nbsp; Walking from
the place of meeting to the hustings, Sir Denis was proposed by
the Mayor, and seconded by Francis Edward Williams, Esq., as the
member for the city of Worcester.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Wilde spoke on
his behalf, and no other candidate having been proposed, Sir
Denis was declared duly elected.&nbsp; He afterwards spoke at
some length, declaring himself a thorough free trader, and
generally a supporter of the Liberal government.&nbsp; Edward
Evans, Esq., and George Allies, Esq., then moved a vote of thanks
to their late representative, Sir Thomas Wilde, and it was
carried with loud acclamations.&nbsp; Sir Thomas replied with
great <i>empressement</i> and feeling, and after a vote of thanks
to the Sheriff, Mr. Elgie, the singular election of 1846
ended.&nbsp; The gentleman thus suddenly made the representative
of Worcester proved, during the short time he held that office,
one of the most practically useful members which the city ever
had.&nbsp; Four days elapsed between the election and the usual
procession, and in that interval Sir Denis returned to town to
negociate, as is generally believed, the support of the
<i>Times</i> to the Whig ministry.&nbsp; The subsequent tone of
the &ldquo;leading journal&rdquo; may be supposed to give some
corroboration to this rumour.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Denis Le Marchant and Mr. Bailey, having
each withdrawn their pretensions to represent the city (the
latter, in order that he might be elected for his native county
of Breconshire), both political parties had to look out for fresh
candidates.&nbsp; The Liberals fixed upon Osman Ricardo, Esq., of
Bromsberrow Place, a country gentleman who had taken little part
in <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>public
matters, but was known as a man of principle, and who laid
himself out for the substantial good of the neighbourhood in
which he lived.&nbsp; The Conservatives were not quite so easily
suited, or so unanimous in their choice.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant
Glover was first named by one section of the party, but he at
length gave way to Mr. F. Rufford, who, as chairman of the
Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway Company, possessed
some amount of popularity in the city.&nbsp; Mr. Rufford, in his
addresses to the electors, indignantly denied that he was a
monopolist, and certainly led people to believe that he was what
was called in common parlance, &ldquo;a free trader,&rdquo; and
on the hustings said, &ldquo;I am here to advocate free trade to
its fullest extent,&rdquo; but in practice he turned out to be a
Protectionist.&nbsp; Mr. Robert Hardy again came forward on the
Radical interest, avowed his desire to see a separation of Church
and State, and disapproved of Government education.</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Lilly and Mr. Alderman John Hall proposed Mr.
Hardy; Mr. William Stallard, jun., and Mr. H. D. Carden, Mr.
Rufford; and Dr. Hastings and Mr. Alderman Edward Evans, Mr.
Ricardo.&nbsp; The show of hands being in favour of Messrs.
Ricardo and Hardy, a poll was demanded for Mr. Rufford, and at
its close the numbers were&mdash;Ricardo, 1,163; Rufford, 1,142;
Hardy, 930.&nbsp; The &ldquo;open house&rdquo; iniquity rioted in
a rankness which had never been equalled at previous
elections.&nbsp; Probably, too, half the electors were paid for
their votes under what is called &ldquo;the messenger
dodge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Rufford, in 1851, became a bankrupt, and
his examinations showed that he certainly was not solvent when he
offered himself as a candidate at this election, yet he admitted
that he expended considerably more than &pound;4,000.</p>
<h3>EVESHAM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Evesham</span> has enjoyed the privilege
of sending two representatives to Parliament from a very early
date.&nbsp; In 1295 two burgesses were chosen to represent the
town in a parliament of Edward I, but there is no record of any
return from that date till the incorporation of the borough by
James I.&nbsp; Some of the elections which have taken place here
during the present century have been <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>remarkable for profuseness of
expenditure and tricks of party warfare.&nbsp; The number of
voters now on the register is 345.</p>
<p>1802&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Charles Thelluson, Esq., the former member,
Patrick Crawford Bruce, Esq., a London merchant, and Humphrey
Howorth, Esq., for many years a physician in India, were the
candidates.&nbsp; After five days&rsquo; poll the latter retired
from the contest, the number of votes then being&mdash;Thelluson,
261; Bruce, 249; Howorth, 183.&nbsp; A petition was afterwards
presented against the return, on the score of alleged bribery,
but the committee report that the sitting members were duly
returned, though the petition was not frivolous.</p>
<p>1806&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Mr. Howorth and W. Manning, Esq., a West India
merchant, returned without opposition, neither of the former
members standing again.</p>
<p>1807&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Masseh Manasseh Lopez, Bart., entered the
field at this election against the former members, and after six
days&rsquo; poll, the numbers of votes recorded stood
thus&mdash;Manning, 494; Lopez, 334; Howorth, 320.&nbsp; This
result was obtained by the returning officer admitting 122
freeholders to the poll, contrary to former decisions, which had
determined that freemen and paymasters alone had the right to
vote.&nbsp; &ldquo;A most gratifying interchange of compliments
passed,&rdquo; says the reporter of the period, &ldquo;during the
closing of the poll books, between the candidates, the mayor (W.
Soley, Esq.), the assessor, and the professional gentlemen
employed; and though perhaps there never was a severer contest,
yet never was the conduct observed more honourable to all
parties.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to have been altogether, and
undisguisedly, a matter of money.&nbsp; In a few days after the
election an address was presented to Mr. Howorth, by E. Rudge,
Esq., and 189 burgesses, complimenting him upon his conduct in
the House of Commons, and begging him &ldquo;to bring their joint
cause before a committee of the House,&rdquo; assured that
&ldquo;their insulted rights will be henceforward fixed on such a
basis as will baffle the attempts of those who will dare to
violate them.&rdquo;&nbsp; A petition was accordingly presented,
and in 1808, February 22nd, the report of the committee was
brought up, and Sir M. M. Lopez, Bart., was declared to have been
unduly elected, and Mr. Howorth ought to have been returned;
opposition to petition not frivolous.&nbsp; Mr. Howorth, in his
published address after this result, declares that he was ousted
at the election by the votes of &ldquo;a class of persons having
no common <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>interest or common feeling with the freemen and
inhabitants of the borough.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had &ldquo;vindicated
their rights, and triumphed over this foreign
influence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Howorth&rsquo;s constituents
afterwards presented him with a piece of plate.</p>
<p>1812&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;W. Manning and H. Howorth, Esqs., re&euml;lected
without opposition.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;A very sharp contest distinguished by all sorts
of man&oelig;uvres, violence, and questionable practices.&nbsp;
The poll was kept open for twelve days, and the numbers at its
close were&mdash;for Mr. Howorth, 410; Mr. Rouse Boughton, 359;
and Sir Charles Cockerell, 341.&nbsp; Mr. Rouse Boughton was son
of Sir Charles William Rouse Boughton, Bart., and Sir Charles
Cockerell, was a brother to Lord Northwick.&nbsp; Two petitions
were presented as soon as Parliament met, against Mr. Rouse
Boughton&rsquo;s return; one from Sir Charles, alleging bribery,
and another from voters of Evesham, against the admission of the
votes of certain persons.&nbsp; It seemed that it had actually
been the custom to admit any man to vote who had paid poor-rates
for six months prior to an election, so that Evesham almost
enjoyed universal suffrage.&nbsp; It was, however, against these
votes that the petition was presented.&nbsp; The committee
decided that Mr. Boughton was not duly elected, and struck off
all the scot and lot voters from the roll, declaring that the
election of members for Evesham was vested in the mayor,
aldermen, capital and other burgesses, members of the
corporation.&nbsp; The name of Sir Charles Cockerell was ordered
to be inserted in the return in lieu of that of Mr. Rouse
Boughton.&nbsp; Lord Palmerston was taken into custody for not
being present when this committee was ballotted for, but
discharged, of course, on payment of the fees, amounting to
&pound;30.&nbsp; A handsome piece of plate was afterwards
presented by the supporters of Mr. Boughton, to Mr. Edward Lawes,
of Sergeant&rsquo;s Inn, for his exertions on that
gentleman&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Charles Cockerell, Bart., and Mr. William E.
Rouse Boughton elected without opposition; Mr. Howorth having
retired from the representation because of continued
ill-health.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;There were three candidates in the field when
this election was first talked of: Sir Charles Cockerell (one of
the former members), Sir Roger Gresley, Bart., and Mr. Protheroe;
but a coalition was formed between Sir Charles and Mr. Protheroe,
and Sir Roger Gresley retired from the contest.&nbsp; Mr. William
E. Rouse Boughton did not again offer himself.&nbsp; Many <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of the
electors were very angry at being &ldquo;sold,&rdquo; as they
called it, and looked out for a third candidate, who would spend
a proper quantity of money, and they found one in the person of
Patrick Grant, Esq., of Spring Gardens, London, who drove up to
the hustings just in time to be put in nomination.&nbsp; Having
stood a three days&rsquo; poll, however, he retired; the numbers
then being&mdash;Cockerell, 235; Protheroe, 137; Grant, 87.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir C. Cockerell and Lord Kennedy (heir apparent
of the Earl of Cassilis) returned.&nbsp; Alexander Raphael, Esq.,
of London, was a third candidate, but retired after two
days&rsquo; poll; the numbers then being&mdash;Cockerell, 231;
Kennedy, 148; Raphael, 110.&nbsp; The return was immediately
petitioned against, on the score of bribery and treating, and it
was proved that sixteen freemen had gone down from London and
received &pound;12 each (for their loss of time it was said),
independently of their expenses.&nbsp; The election was declared
void (Mr. Raphael being implicated in this bribery), and both Sir
Charles Cockerell and Lord Kennedy were thus incapacitated from
sitting in that Parliament.&nbsp; The issue of another writ was
suspended, on the motion of the Marquis of Chandos, to allow of
time for further Parliamentary inquiry.&nbsp; The Marquis
afterwards brought in a bill for the disenfranchisement of the
borough, which was read a second time; but Parliament was
dissolved before it could be passed, and a writ was, therefore,
issued to the returning officer in the usual course.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Charles Cockerell and Lord Kennedy (the
lately ousted members), and Thomas Hudson, Esq. (Reformer), a
Portuguese merchant, were the candidates at this election; and
the numbers at the close of the poll were&mdash;Sir Charles, 208;
Mr. Hudson, 157; Lord Kennedy, 136.&nbsp; The two former
gentlemen were then declared duly elected.&nbsp; Lord Kennedy did
not appear in the town at all during the election.</p>
<p>Evesham having been retained in schedule C of the Reform Bill,
continued to send two members to Parliament in spite of the
smallness of the population&mdash;at that time only numbering
3,998 individuals.&nbsp; The out-voters being deprived of their
right to poll, the number of electors was only 359.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Charles Cockerell and Mr. Hudson
re&euml;lected.&nbsp; Mr. Rudge, Mr. Skirrow, and other gentlemen
had &ldquo;come like shadows and so departed,&rdquo; declaring
their intentions to be third candidates, but suddenly retreating
from the field.&nbsp; However, at the eleventh hour, Mr. Peter
Borthwick, who had <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>signalised himself by lectures in favour of negro
slavery, was put forward by the Tory party, but only received 126
votes&mdash;Sir Charles Cockerell polling 234, and Mr. Hudson
212.&nbsp; The number of electors who voted was 329.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Charles Cockerell again came forward as a
candidate; but Mr. Hudson retired at the last moment, being
opposed by Mr. Peter Borthwick, the unsuccessful candidate at the
previous election.&nbsp; However, Mr. Rudge was put in nomination
in his absence by the Liberals, and a poll demanded on his
behalf; the show of hands being in favour of Sir Charles and Mr.
Borthwick.&nbsp; On the hustings Mr. George May charged Mr.
Borthwick with having failed as a bookseller in Dalkeith, and
having been excommunicated by the Scotch United Secession
Church.&nbsp; Mr. Borthwick denied it, and said it was a relative
whose debts he had paid for him.&nbsp; Mr. Rudge eventually
declined to stand the poll, and Sir Charles Cockerell and Mr.
Borthwick were declared duly elected.&nbsp; In June a dinner was
given to Mr. Borthwick in the Guildhall, the chair being taken by
Lieutenant Amherst; and a party of 160 sat down.&nbsp; The charge
made against Mr. Borthwick having been repeated in the <i>Bath
Guardian</i>, near which town he then lived, he commenced an
action against the proprietors for libel, which was tried in
April, 1836, and ended in a verdict for Mr. Borthwick on some
counts of the indictment, with &pound;100 damages; but the jury
held it proved that Mr. Borthwick had been a bookseller in
Dalkeith&mdash;had failed&mdash;had been in gaol&mdash;and had
been a professional, but unsuccessful, performer on the stage of
the Surrey Theatre.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span>&mdash;(Election
in consequence of the death of Sir Charles Cockerell.)&mdash;The
candidates were Lord Marcus Cecil Hill, brother of the Marquis of
Downshire, on the Liberal interest, and George Rushout Bowles,
Esq., nephew of Lord Northwick and the Dowager Lady Cockerell, on
the Conservative side.&nbsp; On the hustings, Lord Hill was
proposed by Mr. Benjamin Workman and Mr. T. N. Foster; and Mr.
Bowles by Mr. Thomas Blayney and the Rev. Joseph Harling.&nbsp;
The Mayor declared the show of hands to be in favour of Mr.
Bowles, though his decision was questioned.&nbsp; The contest was
a close one, ending in Mr. Bowles&rsquo;s election; the numbers
being&mdash;Bowles, 165; Hill, 140.&nbsp; About 60 electors did
not vote.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;The Hon. George Rushout and Mr. Peter Borthwick,
the former members, coalesced to prevent the return of Lord
Marcus Hill&mdash;who, for the second time, came forward on the
Liberal interest&mdash;and they were successful; the numbers <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>being&mdash;for Rushout, 168; Borthwick, 166; Hill,
156.&nbsp; Of 490 votes recorded, 124 were plumpers; and 119 of
these were for Lord Hill.&nbsp; The Liberal party were loud in
their indignation against the bribery which they asserted to have
been practised.&nbsp; The return was petitioned against; and the
committee ballotted for, consisted of six Conservatives and five
Liberals: Sir Robert Peel, Bart., being chairman.&nbsp; Mr.
Cockburn and Mr. Rushton were the counsel for the petitioners,
and Mr. Thessiger, Mr. Austin, &amp;c., for the sitting
members.&nbsp; Shortly after the opening of the case, the
petition, as far as regarded Mr. Rushout, was abandoned, and Mr.
Borthwick alone proceeded against.&nbsp; Mr. Borthwick was
charged with bribery, both by himself and his agents; he was also
declared to want qualification; and as many as 100 of his votes
were objected to.&nbsp; The cases of bribery alone were gone
into; and the one proved was that of Ebenezer Pierce, to whom Mr.
Borthwick had presented a silver snuff box.&nbsp; He canvassed
this voter personally, about a week before the election, and
promised him a silver snuff box, which Mr. Charles Best
afterwards brought him, with Mr. Borthwick&rsquo;s compliments,
and told him to put it by till after the election.&nbsp; It was
proved that the box had been purchased at Stow and
Mortimer&rsquo;s by Mr. Borthwick, in the interim, and he had
ordered them to engrave on it&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ex dono amici sui
conducit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The committee, upon this, decided that
Mr. Borthwick had been guilty of bribery.&nbsp; Mr. Austin
abandoned the scrutiny, and permitted Lord Marcus Hill to be put
in a majority of one, by permitting the votes of several persons,
who admitted that they had been Mr. Borthwick&rsquo;s paid
agents, to be struck off; but he declared that the decision of
the committee in the snuff box case had struck him with the
utmost surprise, and begged to be allowed to call evidence to
clear Mr. Borthwick&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Mr. Cockburn did not
object, but the committee refused to hear any more
evidence.&nbsp; The committee reported on March 20, 1838, and the
return being amended, Lord Marcus Hill took his seat immediately
afterwards.&nbsp; Soon after the decision of the committee was
known, a dinner was given to Mr. Borthwick, and he was presented
with an oblong silver salver, which had been subscribed for by
the wives and daughters of the Conservative electors.&nbsp; The
Rev. Mr. Harling presented the plate, and J. Amherst, Esq.,
presided at the dinner.&nbsp; Mr. Borthwick made a very long
speech, reviewing his connection with the borough, and
animadverting upon his late colleague, Mr. Rushout, in unmeasured
terms, for having forsaken him before the committee.&nbsp; The
language he made use of caused a challenge, and <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>the two
gentlemen met at Wormwood Scrubs.&nbsp; After a second discharge,
without effect, Mr. Borthwick withdrew the offensive
expressions.&nbsp; Lord Marcus Hill was also entertained at a
dinner at the Town Hall, over which T. N. Foster, Esq., (the
Mayor) presided; and a party of 200 gentlemen sat down to the
tables.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;The candidates were again Lord Marcus Hill, Mr.
Rushout, and Mr. Peter Borthwick; the latter, indeed, did not
make his appearance throughout the election, but he was strongly
supported by a section of the Conservatives, who thought he had
been ill used by Mr. Rushout in the matter of the previous
election&mdash;and, generally, he seemed to be a favourite with
the populace.&nbsp; At the hustings, Lord Marcus Hill was
proposed by Edward Rudge, Esq., and the Rev. B. Bonaker; Mr.
Rushout by Dr. Beale Cooper and the Rev. M. Shaw; and Mr.
Borthwick by R. Blayney, Esq., and G. Eades, Esq.&nbsp; Mr.
Francis Holland spoke for Mr. Borthwick; and on the show of
hands, three-fourths of the meeting held up theirs for that
gentleman, about one half for Lord Marcus, and but few for Mr.
Rushout.&nbsp; At the close of the poll the numbers
were&mdash;Hill, 188; Borthwick, 161; Rushout, 137.&nbsp; Lord
Hill had 108 plumpers; Borthwick, 42; and Rushout, 34.&nbsp;
After the canvass, but prior to the election, Lord Marcus was
made a privy councillor, and appointed to the office of
Comptroller of the Royal Household.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Mr. Borthwick retired from the representation,
and his place was taken by Sir Henry Willoughby, a moderate
Conservative and free trader.&nbsp; A third candidate came into
field, late in the day, in the person of Sir Ralph Howard,
formerly member for Wicklow, who professed Radical views.&nbsp;
At the nomination, Lord Marcus Hill and Sir Ralph Howard had the
show of hands.&nbsp; The polling was a very quiet affair, and at
the close of the struggle Lord Marcus Hill was found to have 195
votes; Sir Henry Willoughby, 172; and Sir Ralph Howard, 131.</p>
<h3>DROITWICH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Droitwich</span> was formerly one of the
closest of Whig boroughs, and was entirely under the influence of
the Foley family.&nbsp; To the return for the first election
recorded below, the names of nineteen persons are appended in the
books of the Droitwich Corporation; and at a much <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>more recent
date, ten persons returned two members to Parliament.&nbsp; The
present constituency of the borough numbers 368.</p>
<p>1802&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General

<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Mr. J. H. H. Foley and Sir T. E. Winnington
elected; the Earl of Sefton making way for the hon. baronet.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;The borough was deprived of one of its members
by the Reform Bill; and on this occasion J. H. H. Foley, Esq.,
was returned alone, having been proposed by Sir A. Lechmere,
Bart., and seconded by T. T. Vernon, Esq.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;For the first time since
1711 this borough was contested and a Tory returned.&nbsp; The
candidates were J. H. H. Foley, Esq. (the former member), and
John Barneby, Esq., of Brockhampton.&nbsp; The former was
proposed by Captain Vernon and Mr. Francis; the latter, by Dr.
Steward and Mr. Lilley, of Wichbold.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Topham
also addressed the populace in Mr. Foley&rsquo;s favour, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>and bore
testimony to his attachment to the Church.&nbsp; The show of
hands was in Mr. Foley&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; At the end of the
first day the numbers were&mdash;Barneby, 115; Foley, 113: and at
the close of the poll&mdash;Barneby, 125; Foley, 122: majority
for Barneby, 3.&nbsp; Out of a constituency of only 281, 34 did
not vote.&nbsp; The election issued in a petition against the
return, and on the 17th of March a committee of the house was
ballotted for to decide the matter; but it was constituted very
unfavourably to Mr. Foley, having at least eight Tories upon
it.&nbsp; They refused to reopen the register, so the inquiry was
limited to a few disputed votes on either side.&nbsp; Mr. Foley
succeeded in striking off three of Mr. Barneby&rsquo;s votes, and
so reducing matters to an equality; but Mr. Barneby then struck
off Lord Southwell&rsquo;s vote, objected to on account of his
peerage.&nbsp; This left Mr. Foley in a minority of one, and Mr.
Barneby retained his seat.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;John Barneby, Esq., having determined to contest
the county, made way for Mr. Pakington to come in for this
borough, of which he has ever since been the
representative.&nbsp; J. H. Galton, Esq., of Hadsor, made a
canvass of the electors on the Liberal interest; but finding that
his chances were not very good he retired from the contest.&nbsp;
Mr. Allen, barrister, also made a flying visit to the place,
intending to put up as a Reformer, but soon took his
departure.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington was proposed at the hustings by W.
H. Ricketts, Esq., and Mr. John Tolley; and having made a long
confession of his political creed (in which he avowed himself a
staunch Conservative, but would not vote for a repeal of the Malt
Tax, and approved of the new Poor Law), he was declared duly
elected.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;J. S. Pakington, Esq., re&euml;lected without
opposition.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Mr. C. Lloyd, nephew of Lord Mostyn, canvassed
the electors on the Liberal interest, and had some promise of
support from the agents of a noble lord in the neighbourhood
(Lord Ward), who was expected rather to have thrown his influence
into the Conservative scale; but, notwithstanding this, Mr. Lloyd
found that he had very little chance of success, and consequently
retired, leaving the field free for Sir John Pakington, Bart.,
who was re&euml;lected.</p>
<h3>BEWDLEY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span>, before the Reform Bill, was a
close Tory borough, <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>with some thirty or forty self-elected burgesses, who
returned their member with no confusion or turmoil.&nbsp; Under
the new state of things, Stourport joins with it in the exercise
of the franchise, and the united constituency now includes 371
electors.&nbsp; Parties have been very evenly balanced here of
late years.</p>
<p>1802&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General

represented the town, again chosen.</p>

<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;After the passing of the Reform Bill, Mr.
Roberts did not choose again to offer himself, and Sir Thomas
Winnington, Bart., was elected without opposition.&nbsp; He was
proposed by Arthur Skey, Esq., and Jonathan Worthington, Esq.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Thomas Winnington re&euml;lected without
opposition.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir Thomas Winnington resigned in favour of his
son, T. E. Winnington, Esq., who was elected without
opposition.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;For the first time this century this borough was
contested, Mr. Robert Monteith, son of a Lanarkshire gentleman
who had accumulated a fortune as a Glasgow merchant, coming
forward to oppose Sir Thomas Edward Winnington.&nbsp; At the
nomination Sir Thomas was proposed by A. Skey, Esq., and seconded
by J. Williams, Esq.; and Mr. Monteith by W. A. Roberts, Esq.,
and K. Watson, Esq.&nbsp; Sir Thomas declared himself for an
alteration of the Corn Laws, but for some measure of
protection.&nbsp; Mr. Monteith declared himself a thorough
Conservative.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of Mr.
Monteith, and the struggle throughout was a most severe
one.&nbsp; In the Bewdley district Mr. Monteith had a majority of
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>eight, but
this was more than counterbalanced by Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
advantage at Stourport.&nbsp; The total numbers
were&mdash;Winnington, 173; Monteith, 168: majority, 5.&nbsp; A
scrutiny was threatened but not proceeded with.&nbsp; A dinner
was afterwards given at the Swan Inn, Stourport, to congratulate
Sir Thomas Winnington on his return.&nbsp; The chair was filled
by George Harris, Esq., and the vice chairs by B. Devey and P.
Baldwin, Esqs.; and the company numbered 180.&nbsp; In September,
the Conservative party entertained Mr. Monteith at a dinner in a
large marquee&mdash;400 persons sitting down to the tables; Slade
Baker, Esq., presided.&nbsp; In the ensuing month Mr. Monteith
sent &pound;100 to be distributed amongst the various charities
of the two towns.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>&mdash;(General
Election.)&mdash;Sir T. Winnington was again opposed, and this
time successfully, by Thomas James Ireland, Esq., of Hooton Hall,
Suffolk, professing high Church and State principles, and liberal
in the expenditure of his money.&nbsp; At the hustings, Sir
Thomas was proposed by Mr. Skey and Mr. Baldwin; and Mr. Ireland
by Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Heath.&nbsp; The show of hands was in Mr.
Ireland&rsquo;s favour, and after a most exciting struggle Mr.
Ireland was declared to have 160 votes, and Sir Thomas only
158.</p>
<p>The return was petitioned against; and on the 4th March, 1848,
the inquiry commenced before the Parliamentary committee,
consisting of three Liberals and two Conservatives.&nbsp; Mr.
Sergeant Wrangham and Mr. Sergeant Kinglake were the principal
counsel employed by Sir Thomas Winnington; and Mr. Alexander, by
Mr. Ireland.&nbsp; After five days&rsquo; examination of
witnesses, the committee decided that Mr. Ireland was not duly
elected&mdash;that it had been proved that a voter, named Price,
had received &pound;15 for his vote&mdash;and that treating had
been proved against Mr. Ireland&rsquo;s agents.&nbsp; The
recriminatory case against Sir Thomas Winnington occupied six
days, and the committee decided that he had been guilty of
treating, by his agents, and that therefore the election was
void.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie, his principal agent, was himself examined,
and proved that 26 or 27 inns were opened on Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
side, some of which supplied as many as 1,000 gallons a
day.&nbsp; The committee made a special report to the House that
a most pernicious system of intimidation, kidnapping and treating
prevailed in the borough, and the writ was suspended, on the
motion of Mr. Hume, until the evidence was printed and laid
before the house.&nbsp; On the 12th of April, Captain Rushout
moved that a new writ should issue, but Sir John Hanmer proposed
its further suspension.&nbsp; After a debate, in which the
corruption disclosed <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>in the evidence before the committee
was pretty freely commented upon, the House came to a division,
and 80 members voted for issuing the writ, and 38 against it; so
the writ was ordered, and a fresh election took place
in&mdash;</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 17&mdash;The
candidates on this occasion were Viscount Mandeville, son of the
Duke of Manchester (Conservative), and the Hon. Spencer Lyttelton
(Liberal).&nbsp; On the hustings, Mr. Lyttelton was proposed by
Mr. Skey and Mr. Pierce Baldwin; and Viscount Mandeville by Mr.
Nicholas and Mr. Heath.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of
Mr. Lyttelton, but Viscount Mandeville headed the poll
throughout; the numbers at the close being&mdash;Mandeville, 171;
Lyttelton, 156.&nbsp; Of course this election was, to a great
extent, free from the corrupt practices of former ones, but the
circumstances under which it occurred furnished matter enough for
excitement.</p>
<h3>KIDDERMINSTER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Kidderminster</span> once returned two
members to Parliament, but not liking to have to pay them was,
upon its own petition, relieved of the
&ldquo;honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was again enfranchised by the
Reform Bill; but had only one member allotted to it.&nbsp; The
constituency here is remarkably small, in comparison with the
population, owing to so few of the operatives living in houses
which pay &pound;10 a year rent.&nbsp; The number of electors now
on the register, including duplicates, is 490.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;In anticipation of the
passing of the Reform Bill, Richard Godson, Esq., a barrister on
the Oxford Circuit, who was very popular with the weavers because
of his successful defence of some of their number when tried for
riot, made an entry into the town on the 4th April, 1831, and
gave a public statement of his political principles.&nbsp; He was
not, he said, the nominee of some lord, but one of the people,
come to represent the people.&nbsp; The Reform Bill was merely a
restoration of the good old constitution, which would give every
man his proper weight in the national assembly.&nbsp; All other
reforms must follow it; the defects of the church must be
removed; and, especially, there must be a free trade in
corn.&nbsp; And though he was interested in a West Indian <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>estate he
should advocate Emancipation, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; His reception
was, altogether, most enthusiastic.&nbsp; He was, however,
opposed by G. R. Phillips, Esq., of Weston House, Warwickshire,
also professing reform principles.&nbsp; Mr. Phillips was
proposed, on the hustings, by J. Newcombe, Esq., and H. Talbot,
Esq.; and Mr. Godson by William Boycot, jun., Esq., and Mr. James
Cole.&nbsp; A very severe contest took place, and the numbers at
the close were&mdash;Godson, 172; Phillips, 159: majority for
Godson, 13.&nbsp; The total constituency was 388.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Godson was again
opposed by Mr. Phillips.&nbsp; Mr. Godson still professed to be a
Reformer, but was supported by the Conservatives.&nbsp; The show
of hands was almost even, but decided by the High Bailiff in Mr.
Godson&rsquo;s favour, and a poll was demanded by Mr. Phillips,
who was, eventually, returned by a majority of 73; the numbers
being&mdash;Phillips, 197; Godson, 124.&nbsp; Mr. Phillips
refused to be chaired, saying that he should spend the money
amongst the people in other ways.&nbsp; On the 10th of June, a
piece of plate (ornament for the dinner table, in silver, worth
&pound;150) was presented to Mr. Godson, by 1,975 inhabitants of
the borough, &ldquo;in grateful remembrance of his ever watchful,
independent, and patriotic conduct when in
Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; The presentation was made by Mr.
Alderman Joseph Boycot, on the balcony of the Lion Hotel, in the
presence of some 7,000 persons.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Phillips, some time
before the writ was issued for this election, declared his
intention of withdrawing all pretensions to the representation;
being evidently afraid of a defeat, or that a triumph could only
be purchased on terms too dear.&nbsp; Mr. Godson, however, found
an opponent in the person of John Bagshaw, Esq., ex-M.P. for
Sudbury.&nbsp; Mr. Godson was proposed by Mr. Morton and Mr.
Cole; Mr. Bagshaw by Mr. Turner and Mr. Joseph Newcombe.&nbsp;
The show of hands was considerably in Mr. Godson&rsquo;s favour,
and a poll was demanded for Mr. Bagshaw.&nbsp; Mr. Godson headed
the poll from the first, and in the course of the afternoon Mr.
Bagshaw retired; the numbers being&mdash;Godson, 198; Bagshaw,
157.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Godson was opposed by
Mr. Sampson Ricardo, brother of Osman Ricardo, Esq., who came
forward at the last moment, after the Liberals had been
disappointed by the candidate they had fixed upon&mdash;a Mr.
Rennie.&nbsp; Mr. Godson was proposed by Mr. Morton and Mr. Cole;
Mr. Ricardo by Mr. Charles Talbot and Mr. H. Worth; and the Mayor
fairly enough <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>declared the show of hands to be in his favour, though,
for so doing, he was assailed by the Conservatives in a most
discourteous manner.&nbsp; The contest was, what Kidderminster
contests always have been, a very sharp one; but Mr. Godson was
returned by a majority of 12; the numbers being&mdash;Godson,
212; Ricardo, 200.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Godson was
re&euml;lected without opposition.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>&mdash;(Vacancy
occasioned by the sudden demise of Mr. Richard Godson.)&mdash;The
first candidate in the field was John Best, Esq., a barrister of
short standing, son of W. B. Best, Esq., of Blakebrook House, who
came forward as a Conservative and Protectionist.&nbsp; Thomas
Gisborne Esq., of Yoxall Park, near Burton-on-Trent, next made
his appearance on the Reform side, professing very liberal
opinions.&nbsp; He had, formerly, been member for
Nottingham.&nbsp; A diversion was speedily effected by the
arrival of a third man, in the person of Crawshay Bailey, Esq.,
of Tredegar, South Wales, who was also Conservative in his views,
and apparently entertaining similar opinions to those of Mr. Best
upon all subjects.&nbsp; He was supported by a very influential
section of the Kidderminster Conservatives, and a downright split
amongst them seemed inevitable.&nbsp; However at the end of a
week Mr. Bailey finding he had little chance, withdrew from the
contest, and left the two first to fight it out.&nbsp;
Considerable soreness of feeling, however, was felt amongst the
Conservatives by this temporary division, and the opponents built
thereupon very sanguine expectations of success.&nbsp; At the
nomination Mr. Best was proposed by Mr. William Boycot, sen., and
Mr. Henry Chellingworth; and Mr. Gisborne by Mr. William Holmes
and Mr. Henry Brinton, in whose favour the show of hands was
declared to be.&nbsp; Mr. Gisborne headed the poll till twelve
o&rsquo;clock, when some thirty voters, who had been supporters
of Mr. Bailey up to the time of his retirement, and who, it was
hoped by one party, and feared by the other, would now remain
neutral, came to the booths and recorded their votes for Mr.
Best.&nbsp; This decided the struggle; and when the clock struck
four, Mr. Best was found to have 217 votes against 200 only
recorded for Mr. Gisborne.&nbsp; The election, on the whole,
passed off quietly, and with decorum.</p>
<p>In the session of 1850 a petition was presented by some of the
Liberal electors against Mr. Best&rsquo;s return, on the score of
bribery and corruption, and the matter came before a committee of
the House of Commons, on the 15th of April.&nbsp; The committee
consisted of Mr. Bouverie (chairman), Lord Enfield, Mr. Augustus
Stafford, Mr. David Morris, and Sir William Joliffe; the majority
being Liberals.&nbsp; <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Mr. Sergeant Kinglake led the case
for the petitioners, and Mr. Alexander, Q.C., for Mr. Best.&nbsp;
The committee sat seven days, and a variety of witnesses were
examined on behalf of the petitioners; but bribery was only
attempted to be proved in two cases, the evidence, on all points,
being decidedly weak.&nbsp; The committee confirmed Mr.
Best&rsquo;s return.</p>
<h3>DUDLEY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> privilege of sending a member
to Parliament was conferred on this borough by the Reform
Bill.&nbsp; The number of voters now on the register is 912.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Sir John
Campbell&mdash;then the Whig Solicitor General, and long a
practitioner on the Oxford Circuit, now Lord Chief Justice of
England&mdash;was returned.&nbsp; He had an opponent in the
person of Horace St. Paul, Esq., who contested the election on
Tory principles.&nbsp; Sir John was proposed by Mr. Twamley and
Mr. Braidley; and Mr. St. Paul by Mr. Dixon and Mr.
Salisbury.&nbsp; The numbers, at the close of the poll,
were&mdash;Campbell, 315; St. Paul, 225: majority for Campbell,
90.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span>
27&mdash;(Election rendered necessary by Sir John
Campbell&rsquo;s elevation to the Attorney
Generalship.)&mdash;Sir John was this time opposed, on the
Conservative interest, by Thomas Hawkes, Esq.&nbsp; The show of
hands, at the nomination, was in favour of Sir John; whereupon a
poll was demanded by Mr. Hawkes&rsquo;s friends, and commenced
immediately with great briskness.&nbsp; At three o&rsquo;clock,
Sir John&rsquo;s committee, finding great difficulty in bringing
their friends to the poll, gave up in a huff, and Mr. Hawkes was
declared duly elected; the numbers being&mdash;Hawkes, 322;
Campbell, 242: majority, 80.&nbsp; This result was said to be
mainly owing to the Dissenters and ultra-radicals refusing to
vote for Sir John, &ldquo;in order to teach ministers a
lesson;&rdquo; but the effect was rather to disgust the Whigs
than to urge them forward with church reform.&nbsp; Sir John had
also made enemies by an attack, in the House, on the Dudley
magistrates.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Hawkes returned by a
majority of 93 over his Whig opponent, Captain Forbes.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Hawkes again
elected.&nbsp; Mr. Merryweather Turner was the candidate on the
Liberal interest, and obtained the show of hands at the
nomination; but at the poll <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the numbers were&mdash;Hawkes, 385;
Turner, 289: majority for Hawkes, 96.&nbsp; A challenge resulted
from some speeches at this election, and the Dudley magistrates
issued their warrants to bind over both Mr. Turner and Mr. Hawkes
to keep the peace.&nbsp; Mr. Turner did not get the challenge
till half an hour after he had been bound over at the instigation
of Mr. Hawkes&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;Mr. Hawkes again elected;
though opposed, on the Liberal interest, by Mr. W. A. Smith, son
of the then member for Norwich.&nbsp; Mr. Downing and Mr. B. Best
proposed Mr. Hawkes at the hustings; and Mr. Thomas Lister and
Mr. Thomas Hill proposed Mr. Smith, who had the show of
hands.&nbsp; The numbers on the poll were&mdash;Hawkes, 436;
Smith, 189: majority for Hawkes, 247.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 8&mdash;Mr.
Thomas Hawkes&rsquo;s acceptance of the Chiltern Hundreds, in
consequence of the embarrassed state of his affairs, having
caused a vacancy, John Benbow, Esq., agent for Lord Ward, and,
therefore, possessing much influence in the borough, was put in
nomination on the Conservative interest, and opposed by Mr.
William Rawson, an Anti-Corn-Law lecturer.&nbsp; Mr. Benbow was
proposed, on the hustings, by Mr. Thomas Badger and Captain
Bennitt; and Mr. Rawson by Mr. Charles Twamley and the Rev. J.
Palmer.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of Mr.
Rawson.&nbsp; The polling was a very quiet affair, and at the
close the numbers were&mdash;Benbow, 388; Rawson, 175: majority,
213.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;(General Election.)&mdash;A Mr. Joseph Linney,
Chartist operative from Bilston, was put in nomination on the day
of election, in opposition to Mr. Benbow&mdash;addressed the
crowd, and got the show of hands; but having no money to pay his
share of the expenses of a poll, was obliged to withdraw, and Mr.
Benbow was declared duly elected.</p>

55</span>ELECTIONS OF COUNTY CORONERS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> number of coroners appointed
for each English county was formerly regulated by usage, the
statute of 3 Edw. I, cap. 10, merely enacting that &ldquo;in all
shires a sufficient number of men should be chosen as
coroners;&rdquo; but it was competent for the Lord Chancellor to
issue a writ for the election of additional coroners, upon a
petition from the freeholders of the county and the approbation
of the justices in quarter sessions.&nbsp; The manner of the
election was regulated by the statute of 58 Geo. III, cap. 35,
and the poll might be kept open ten days.&nbsp; By cap. 6 of 28
Edw. III, it was enacted, &ldquo;that all coroners of the
counties should be chosen in the full counties, by the commons of
the said counties, of the most meet and lawful people that should
be found,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Although by this statute the
election is not expressly confined to freeholders, yet as none
but freeholders are suitors at the county court (who were
&ldquo;the commons of the counties&rdquo; referred to by this
statute) the usage has been for freeholders only to vote.&nbsp;
The amount of estate not being defined, any <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> freehold interest in lands in the county, however small,
will confer the right to vote.&nbsp; Previous to the division of
the counties into districts&mdash;power to do which was given to
the Privy <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Council, on petition of the County Justices, by 7 and 8
Vic., cap. 92&mdash;each coroner acted throughout the whole
county, and every freeholder was entitled to vote at each
election.&nbsp; Now, however, the coroners, though still
considered coroners for the whole county, cannot hold inquests
out of their respective districts, except in special cases; and
only the freeholders residing within the district are entitled to
vote at the election for that district.&nbsp; The justices, of
course, virtually assign the districts; and a dispute which arose
in this county, between the magistrates and one of the coroners,
on his claiming compensation for loss of emolument by the
division they had made, will be found noticed in a subsequent
part of this work.&nbsp; The poll at elections for coroners is
now limited to two days.</p>
<p>1801&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 13&mdash;Richard
Barneby, Esq., elected coroner in the room of Humphrey Littleton,
Esq., deceased.&nbsp; No opposition.</p>
<p>1809&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 26&mdash;Election
of a coroner for the county, in the room of Mr. George Best,
removed, took place this day at the Talbot Inn, Claines.&nbsp;
Mr. Godson, of Tenbury, Mr. Cheek, of Evesham, and Mr. Griffiths,
of Broadway, were the candidates; but to save the expenses of a
poll, they agreed to leave the choice to three
gentlemen&mdash;one nominated by each candidate.&nbsp; The
gentlemen chosen were&mdash;J. Philips, Esq., H. Wakeman, Esq.,
and T. Bund, Esq.; and they determined (by drawing lots) on Mr.
Godson, of Tenbury, who was thereupon declared duly elected.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span>
14&mdash;Election for a coronership in consequence of the
resignation of Mr. Richard Barneby.&nbsp; The candidates on this
occasion were Mr. J. H. Griffiths, of Broadway, and Mr. George
Hill, of Worcester.&nbsp; Both candidates rested their claim for
support on the locality of their residence&mdash;Mr. Griffiths
saying that, as the other coroners lived one at Chaddesley and
the other at Tenbury, the Evesham side ought to have one resident
there&mdash;and Mr. Hill contending that there should be one, at
least, living in the county town.&nbsp; The nomination took place
at the Talbot, in the Tything, Worcester; and Mr. Griffiths was
proposed by T. Bund, Esq., of Wick, and seconded by &mdash;
Knowles, Esq., Broadway; Mr. Hill by R. Berkeley, Esq.,
Spetchley, and seconded by Philip Gresley, Esq., <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>High
Park.&nbsp; The numbers after the first day&rsquo;s poll
were&mdash;Hill, 395; Griffiths, 79: and then Mr. Griffiths
retired from the contest.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 10&mdash;Mr.
Thomas Hallen, of Kidderminster, elected a county coroner, in the
room of Mr. Fidkin, deceased.&nbsp; Mr. H. Robeson, of
Bromsgrove, had been a candidate, but retired before the
election.&nbsp; Mr. Hallen was proposed by E. M. Wigley, Esq., of
Shakenhurst, and seconded by the Rev. R. F. Onslow, vicar of
Kidderminster.</p>
<p>1822&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
27&mdash;Election to supply the place of William Godson, Esq., of
Tenbury, then lately deceased.&nbsp; The nomination took place in
the College Yard, at the east end of the Cathedral.&nbsp; Earl
Mountnorris proposed Mr. Charles Best, of Evesham, and this
nomination was seconded by Thomas B. Cooper, Esq.; T. S. Vernon,
Esq., proposed, and John Phillips, Esq., of Hanbury Hall,
seconded, Mr. S. H. Godson, of Tenbury, son of the deceased
coroner.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of Mr. Best, and
Mr. Godson demanded a poll.&nbsp; This went on vigorously till
five o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when the numbers
were&mdash;Best, 635; Godson, 230.&nbsp; Mr. Godson then retired
from the contest, and Mr. Best was duly sworn in.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 13&mdash;The
most determined contest ever known in this county for a
coronership commenced this day.&nbsp; Immediately on the death of
Mr. George Hill, five candidates announced themselves for the
office&mdash;viz., Mr. William Smith, Worcester; Mr. Frederick
Stokes, Worcester; Mr. Stephen Godson, Worcester; Mr. Charles
Beville Dryden, Worcester; Mr. Thomas Davis, Worcester; and Mr.
Skey, Upton.&nbsp; Of these, however, all had withdrawn before
the nomination day, excepting Mr. Smith and Mr. Stokes.&nbsp; The
Sheriff had at first fixed that the nomination should take place
in the Castle Yard, but this property had recently been sold by
Government to Mr. Eaton, with a reservation of it for the
nomination of members of Parliament; but nothing had been said
(according to Mr. Eaton&rsquo;s view of the matter) about
coroners, therefore he refused to allow it to be used.&nbsp; The
nomination, therefore, took place at the Hare and Hounds Inn,
Sidbury; where Mr. Smith was proposed by Major Bund and John
Williams, Esq.; and Mr. Stokes by Sir Thomas Winnington, Bart.,
and the Rev. George Turberville.&nbsp; The show of hands was
declared to be in favour of Mr. Smith, and a poll was demanded
for his opponent; and this was continued for ten days&mdash;the
utmost period allowed by law.&nbsp; For the first three days Mr.
Stokes headed his adversary considerably; Mr. Smith, on the fifth
day, however, obtained the ascendancy, and kept it, though with
<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>varying
numbers, to the last day, when he very materially increased his
majority, which, in the end, amounted to 189 votes.&nbsp; The
numbers polled were&mdash;Smith, 3,875; Stokes, 3,686: total
number of freeholders polled, 7,561.&nbsp; The contest resolved
itself quite into a political struggle&mdash;Mr. Smith
representing the Tory and Mr. Stokes the Whig interest.&nbsp; The
city, during the progress of the election, was in a state of the
utmost excitement&mdash;the voters being brought in to the sole
polling place, with flags and bands of music, in every possible
description of vehicle.&nbsp; On the sixth day, a fierce fight
took place between the partisans of the two candidates, on their
accidental meeting in the Tything; and several men with broken
heads were taken to the Infirmary.&nbsp; Mr. Stokes, at the
conclusion of the poll, demanded a scrutiny; and the matter of
right and power, on the part of the Sheriff, to grant one, was
formally argued; but it was ultimately refused, and Mr. Smith was
sworn into the office.&nbsp; The contest cost each of the
candidates about &pound;3,000 a day, while it lasted.&nbsp; [The
copy of the reservation clause in Mr. Eaton&rsquo;s conveyance
was afterwards produced, on special application to Government,
and it seemed that the Sheriff was empowered to hold any court in
the Castle Yard which he pleased.]</p>
<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 7&mdash;Mr. W.
S. P. Hughes, solicitor, elected a county coroner, in the room of
Mr. Smith, who had absconded.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes was proposed by
the Rev. George Turberville, seconded by John Williams, Esq., and
no other candidate having offered himself, he was at once
declared duly chosen.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>
28&mdash;Election for county coroner, in the room of Mr. Thomas
Hallen, of Kidderminster, who had resigned.&nbsp; Mr. William
Boycot, jun., of Kidderminster, Mr. Henry Corser, of Stourbridge,
and Mr. Ralph Docker, of Kingsnorton, had offered themselves as
candidates; but the two first withdrew, and it was expected that
Mr. Docker would &ldquo;walk over.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was said that
the three gentlemen had &ldquo;tossed up,&rdquo; and so decided
the matter, but that was denied.&nbsp; However, on the evening
before the election, Mr. Thomas Waters, Clerk of the Peace for
the city, offered himself to the freeholders for election, and
there was every expectation of a sharp contest.&nbsp; Mr. Spooner
proposed Mr. Docker, who was seconded by Mr. Ellis; Mr. Waters
was proposed by Mr. Alderman R. Evans and Mr. Alderman
Stephenson.&nbsp; The show of hands was in favour of Mr. Docker,
and Mr. Evans demanded a poll for Mr. Waters.&nbsp; At the end of
the first day the numbers were&mdash;Docker, 246; Waters, 138:
and Mr. Waters then retired from the contest.</p>

meetings, he will find it in another portion of this work.</p>
<p>1800&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 14&mdash;County
meeting held in Worcester Town Hall, to consider what steps
should be taken in consequence of the high price of provisions,
which was very numerously attended.&nbsp; Resolutions were
passed, begging holders of corn to bring it into the market at
reduced prices; and requesting millers to grind for the poor at
half their usual charge.&nbsp; The Town Hall was granted as a
place of deposit for corn, to be retailed to the poor at prime
cost.&nbsp; The greatest pleasure was evinced by the meeting at
hearing that vessels were arriving from abroad with importations
of wheat.&nbsp; It is recorded that <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>many farmers attended Worcester
market, in consequence of this meeting, and sold wheat at 15s. to
18s. a bushel.</p>
<p>1800&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 7&mdash;County
meeting to congratulate the King on his escape from assassination
by Hadfield; and meetings for a similar purpose held at
Stourbridge, Bromsgrove, &amp;c.</p>
<p>1800&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 9&mdash;A common
hall held at Worcester, at which resolutions were passed to
petition Parliament for fresh enactments against
&ldquo;engrossing,&rdquo; &amp;c., and begging the legislature
<i>to fix a certain price</i>, <i>beyond which it might be
unlawful to sell wheat</i>.</p>
<p>1801&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 25&mdash;Common hall

hall, convened in Worcester, to adopt resolutions relative to the
investigation of the conduct of the Duke of York, as Commander in
Chief, in selling military promotions through his mistress, Mrs.
Clarke.&nbsp; The Mayor occupied the chair.&nbsp; Mr. J. Palmer
moved resolutions, thanking Colonel Wardle, M.P., for promoting
the inquiry, and Mr. Gordon, one of the city members, for voting
for it; which were seconded by Mr. Pope.&nbsp; Mr. J. Williams
moved, as an amendment, that the resolutions should be couched in
more general terms and no names mentioned in them; and Mr. B.
Johnson, Town Clerk, seconded it.&nbsp; The original resolutions
were, however, carried by a large majority.&nbsp; In this meeting
occur the first mutterings of the Reform agitation; for the last
of the resolutions declares that &ldquo;the late decision of the
honourable Commons (negativing Colonel Wardle&rsquo;s motion for
the Duke&rsquo;s dismissal) has disappointed the hopes and
expectations of the people, and convinced us of the necessity of
a speedy and effectual <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>reform in the representation of the
Commons in Parliament, as a security to the throne, a support to
the nobility, and a safeguard to the people&mdash;against that

hall, Worcester, called by requisition to the Mayor, to consider
the best means of preventing the destruction of small fish in the
Severn, and the first Association formed for the protection of
the Fisheries: the great decrease of salmon lamented; and it is
said to fetch 3s. to 4s. a lb.&nbsp; The corporation subscribed
twenty guineas.&nbsp; A great many seizures of illegal nets
speedily made.</p>

meeting, held at the Guildhall, Worcester, Thomas Carden, Esq.,
in the chair, to consider what steps should be adopted for the
relief of the poor, who were suffering severely from the
excessive price of all provisions.&nbsp; A very large
subscription was raised, and it was unanimously resolved that it
should be appropriated to the purchase of bacon, peas, and rice,
to sell again at reduced prices.&nbsp; The total number of
persons applying thus to be assisted was 7,418, and the sum
raised about &pound;1,500.</p>
<p>1813&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 10&mdash;A
common hall held at Worcester, with the Mayor presiding, at which
a petition was unanimously agreed to against the renewal of the

Richards.</p>
<p>1813&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 28&mdash;A

him to call a common hall, for the purpose of addressing H. R. H.

had been contemplated was unanimously agreed to.</p>
<p>1814&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 25&mdash;A common
hall held in Worcester, the Mayor presiding, to petition against
the proposed imposition of corn duties.&nbsp; Mr. Nichols moved a
petition, which was seconded by Mr. Moseley, carried unanimously,
and received 6,000 signatures in two days.&nbsp; The petitioners
declared that corn, during the last twenty years, had been dearer
in this country than in any other in Europe, and, <a

the utmost importance, the manufacturers of this country could
not vie with other markets if the prices of the necessaries of
life could not be brought nearer to the prices of other
countries.&nbsp; If it was imagined that at the then prices of
corn (wheat averaging 8s. 6d. per bushel, and the quartern loaf
selling at 10&frac12;d.) the present rent of land could not be
paid, the petitioners submitted that the proper remedy was to
lower the rents.&nbsp; The artisans, during the war, when the
price of corn and meat was excessive, had behaved themselves in
the most patient, loyal, and laudable manner, and it was hard
that they should not be allowed to share in the blessings of the
peace, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Dudley, Droitwich, &amp;c., petitioned against the measure,
which was rejected by the House of Commons, in bringing up the
report, by 116 to 110.</p>
<p>1814&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 30&mdash;A public
meeting held in Worcester to petition the legislature against
that part of the recent treaty of peace with France which related
to the Slave Trade, and seemed likely to encourage its
revival.&nbsp; The Mayor took the chair.&nbsp; Mr. Stanley
Pumphrey moved, and Mr. Richard Spooner seconded, the resolutions
and petitions, which were unanimously adopted.&nbsp; The
petitions received about 1,000 signatures; and one with a similar
object, sent from Evesham, received 900 signatures.</p>
<p>1814&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 29&mdash;A public
meeting of noblemen, gentlemen, and freeholders of the county
held at the Town Hall, Worcester, to vote an address to the
Prince Regent on the glorious termination of the war.&nbsp; Mr.
Clarke, Under Sheriff, in the chair.&nbsp; The address was moved
by Lord Deerhurst, seconded by the Hon. W. B. Lygon, M.P., and
passed unanimously.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 16&mdash;A
common hall convened in Worcester to address Parliament on the
subject of the property and other war taxes.&nbsp; Mr. Josiah
Palmer first moved resolutions, which were opposed by Major
Wigley, as too strong, and aimed at the landed interest.&nbsp;
Mr. Richard Spooner moved others, which were seconded by Mr.
Hooper, and carried by a considerable majority.&nbsp; A petition
was founded upon them, praying for the repeal of the Income Tax,
and the taxes on malt, tea, leather, and salt.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 25&mdash;A
county meeting held with much the same purpose; Mr. Clarke, Under
Sheriff, in the chair.&nbsp; Mr. E. M. Wigley moved a petition
against the Property Tax, which was seconded by Sir William
Smith, Bart., and adopted without opposition.&nbsp; The meeting
then passed to the consideration of the necessity of some <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>protection to
the farming interest.&nbsp; Mr. Richard Spooner moved a petition
praying that &ldquo;foreign corn, on importation, should be
subjected to the same rate of duty as is now paid by the British
farmer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said the agricultural interest was
greatly depressed, and the foreigners ought to pay a duty
equivalent to the taxes paid by the British farmer.&nbsp; Lord
Foley seconded the adoption of the petition, which was carried by
acclamation.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 6&mdash;A common
hall held in Worcester; Samuel Garmston, Esq., Mayor, in the
chair; to petition against Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s Corn Bill,
preventing the importation of wheat when under 80s. a
quarter.&nbsp; Mr. J. Palmer moved the petition, saying that the
question was one of cheap or dear bread, and not at all the
benefit of the farmers, many of whom signed the petitions against
the bill, for they saw that its object was to ensure the
landholders their enormous rents.&nbsp; The Mayor, Colonel Wall,
Mr. Brown, Mr. Felton, &amp;c., supported the petition, which was
carried with enthusiasm, and <i>received</i> 7,965 <i>signatures
the same afternoon</i>, when it was obliged to be sent off by the
London mail.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Evesham</span>&mdash;One of the most
numerous meetings ever known in this borough was held on this
subject.&nbsp; Mr. Easthope (afterwards Sir John Easthope) moved
the petitions, which were supported by Mr. Phillips, Mr. Barnes,
&amp;c., and opposed by Colonel Cooper, Rev. Mr. Shaw, and Mr.
Phelps.&nbsp; They were carried by a large majority.</p>
<p>1816&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 14&mdash;A county
meeting held, with Joseph Lee, Esq., in the chair, to petition
for a reduction of expenditure.&nbsp; The speakers were E. M.
Wigley, Esq., Lord Deerhurst, Lord Elmley, and the Hon. W. H.
Lyttelton, and the general resolutions were then passed without
opposition.&nbsp; R. Spooner, Esq., then moved a petition praying
for a readjustment of the Property Tax, so that &ldquo;occupiers
of land might not be taxed according to a fictitious assumption
of profit,&rdquo; and further objecting to it as applied to the
ordinary profits of industry.&nbsp; It also prayed for the repeal
of the war taxes on malt and salt.&nbsp; Mr. Wigley moved that
the consideration of the resolution be postponed; and Mr. Talbot
moved as an amendment that the Property Tax ought not, under any
modifications, to be revived.&nbsp; Both these were negatived,
and Mr. Spooner&rsquo;s petition carried.</p>
<p>1816&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 15&mdash;A city
meeting was held for the same purpose, at which very similar
petitions were agreed to.</p>
<p>1817&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 6&mdash;A
common hall held by the Mayor, to vote addresses to the Prince
Regent to congratulate him on his escape from assassination, and
also to petition Parliament &ldquo;to make such <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>arrangements
as should seem likely to restore the commerce, manufactures, and
agriculture of the kingdom to their former flourishing
state,&rdquo; and praying for reduction of expenditure; but
adding that the petitioners &ldquo;looked with anxiety to
Parliament firmly and strenuously to defend the constitution from
the imminent dangers of wild and speculative
innovation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hall was densely crowded.&nbsp; The
address to the Prince Regent was moved by Mr. Lechmere, seconded
by Mr. Spooner, and carried unanimously.&nbsp; But on the
petition being proposed, Mr. Josiah Palmer moved its rejection,
because it did not recommend retrenchment sufficiently, and
because a meeting was to be held on the same subject the
following day.&nbsp; Mr. Richard Mence seconded Mr.
Palmer&rsquo;s amendment in a very energetic speech; and, after
several speeches, the petition was put to the meeting and
decidedly rejected.</p>
<p>1817&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 7&mdash;A
requisition was presented to the Mayor to call a common hall to
petition the legislature in favour of Parliamentary Reform, but
His Worship (R. Chamberlain, Esq.) declined, though he would
grant the use of the hall to the requisitionists for that
purpose.&nbsp; Of this permission they availed themselves; and a
most crowded meeting was assembled, with Mr. Robert Felton in the
chair.&nbsp; The only speakers were Mr. J. Palmer and Mr.
Moseley, who moved petitions for reform, retrenchment, and the
abolition of sinecures, which were carried unanimously, and
forwarded to Lord Deerhurst for presentation.</p>
<p>1817&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 28&mdash;County
meeting and common hall held in Worcester, at which addresses of
condolence were agreed to&mdash;to the Prince Regent, Her
Majesty, and Prince Leopold&mdash;on the death of the Princess
Charlotte.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 12&mdash;A
county meeting held, at which the Earl of Coventry moved, and the
Lord Bishop seconded, an address of condolence to the Prince
Regent on the death of his mother, the Queen; which was, of
course, carried unanimously.&nbsp; A similar address was
presented from the corporation of Worcester.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 1&mdash;A meeting of
the proprietors and occupiers of land in the county of Worcester,
held at the Crown Inn, Broad Street; George Wigley Perrott, Esq.,
in the chair; when it was unanimously resolved that a memorial
should be signed by the parties present, and sent to the Right
Hon. Frederick John Robinson, President of the Board of Trade,
&ldquo;to press the just claims of the cultivators of the soil to
a <i>full</i>, <i>fair</i>, <i>and ample protection</i> from the
legislature; the <i>imperious necessity</i> of which <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>was becoming
daily more and more apparent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The memorial, adopted
by the meeting, stated that &ldquo;the unparalleled quantity of
26,000,000 bushels of foreign corn imported into this kingdom
within the last year, <span class="GutSmall">DUTY FREE</span>, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> and of 13,000,000 lbs. of wool in three
quarters of a year, or nearly so, had occasioned a ruinous loss
to the tenantry and other occupiers of the soil, lessened the
demand for labour, increased the poor rates, diminished the means
of paying for them, and must also have tended materially to
injure the home trade of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
subscribers were&mdash;G. W. Perrott, Cracombe House; C. E.
Hanford, Wooller&rsquo;s Hill; John Hawkes, Allesborough; E. F.
Welles, Earl&rsquo;s Croome; John Fletcher, Hill Croome; John
Onley, Bransford; Thomas Hudson, Pershore; Joseph Smith, Henwick;
Francis Holland, Cropthorne; John Winnall, Braces Leigh; and
William Woodward, Birlingham.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 28&mdash;A
county meeting held at the Guildhall, Worcester, to address His
Majesty on the decease of his venerable father, and to
congratulate him on his accession to the throne.&nbsp; The
address was moved by the Earl of Coventry, as Lord Lieutenant of
the County, and seconded by Lord Beauchamp.</p>
<p>1822&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 8&mdash;A
county meeting to consider agricultural distress; E. Isaac, Esq.,
High Sheriff, in the chair.&nbsp; Mr. J. Richards first addressed
the meeting.&nbsp; He alluded to the circumstances in which the
agricultural interest now found itself.&nbsp; In the previous
session of Parliament the petitions of the farmers had caused the
appointment of a select committee to inquire into the causes of
the distress.&nbsp; They, in their report, admitted that arable
land could now only be cultivated at a loss, but added that
Parliament could grant no redress&mdash;they must look only to
time and patience.&nbsp; But this was a mockery, for they had had
good seasons and harvests, and how then was their case to be
bettered by patience?&nbsp; Mr. George Webb Hall professed to
have discovered a remedy in the imposition of a very heavy duty
on foreign corn&mdash;the object of that was, of course, to
prevent its importation altogether, and increase the price at
home.&nbsp; But if that was done, where were the people to get
money to purchase it?&nbsp; The manufacturers would no longer be
able to compete with foreigners, and people would emigrate by
tens of thousands.&nbsp; It was not true that the price of corn
had fallen because of foreign importation&mdash;the price of meat
had fallen just in the same proportion, and <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>cattle and
sheep were not imported.&nbsp; Prices were low all the world
over, and the only remedy for the present state of things was a
diminution of taxes.&nbsp; If it was asked why corn could not be
grown at 40s. a quarter now, as it could be in 1792, he would
reply, because taxes, rents, and tithes, were all much
higher.&nbsp; The Bank Restriction Act of 1797, and Mr.
Peel&rsquo;s bill of 1819, had committed a fraud in the value of
money; and this was another cause of distress.&nbsp; Ultimate
relief, he thought, would only be obtained from a reformed
Parliament.&nbsp; He moved a series of resolutions in accordance
with these sentiments.&nbsp; Mr. Richard Spooner seconded
them.&nbsp; Mr. Beale Cooper then moved an amendment,
stating&mdash;&ldquo;That for 150 years, from 1663 to 1814,
importation of the produce of the soil was never permitted
without the payment of some duty; and it is a matter of
historical truth that during that time the prosperity of
agriculture, commerce, and manufacture progressively increased to
a height of opulence unexampled in the history of the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the &ldquo;unlimited competition&rdquo;
(after 80s. a quarter) introduced for the first time by the bill
of 1815, the amendment attributed the depression of the produce
of the soil below that of every other commodity, necessarily
caused by diminution of circulating medium, and therefore the
amendment prayed for a prohibitory duty.</p>
<p>Mr. C. E. Hanford said if this amendment passed, the meeting
would be a farce.&nbsp; The Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Bedford,
and Mr. Coke thought the remedy was to be found in retrenchment
and Parliamentary Reform.</p>
<p>Mr. Spooner replied to Mr. Beale Cooper, who had told them
that because corn was imported duty free, therefore it had
diminished in price; but there had been no importation at all for
the last three years, and so that argument must be
fallacious.&nbsp; The conduct of Parliament in endeavouring to
swindle the nation into payment of an unjust debt, which, as it
had been incurred in paper, ought to be paid in paper, showed the
necessity for reform.&nbsp; He was for triennial Parliaments and
an extension of the franchise, so that those who by direct
taxation contributed towards the burdens of his country, should
have a voice in electing those by whom they were imposed.&nbsp;
He had been but a short time in Parliament, but he had had
sufficient opportunity of seeing how matters were managed there;
swarms of boyish members came in just at a division, and only
looked where the Marquis of Londonderry or Mr. Tierney stood, to
see on which side of the house they should go.</p>
<p>Mr. G. W. Perrott seconded Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s amendment,
which, <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>however, was lost by a very large majority.&nbsp; Mr.
Richards&rsquo;s resolutions were then all carried, excepting the
last, which called for Parliamentary Reform; but after several
persons, and the High Sheriff amongst others, had begged him to
withdraw it as not pertinent to the objects of the meeting, that
also was carried by acclamation.&nbsp; Petitions were then agreed
to, founded on Mr. Richards&rsquo;s resolutions, and the meeting
broke up.&nbsp; Lord Foley and Sir Thomas Winnington, who were
unavoidably absent from the meeting, attached their names to the
petitions.</p>
<p>[Lord John Russell, just about this time, wrote a letter to
the farmers of Huntingdonshire, recommending them indeed to seek
for retrenchment and reform, but using all the arguments now in
vogue amongst Protectionists against the importation of corn, and
expressing his fears that Government were going to hand over the
country to political economists.]</p>
<p>1822&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 30&mdash;A meeting
of the inhabitants of Kidderminster held, George Hallen, Esq.,
High Bailiff, in the chair, to petition Parliament for a revision
of the Corn Laws; and it was resolved that the restrictions upon
the importation of corn were inconsistent with sound principles
of national policy, and were proved, by ten years&rsquo;
experience, to be injurious to the general interests of the
community; and a petition was therefore adopted for a moderate
import duty on corn; which, in addition to the unavoidable
expenses of importation, would be a fair protection to the
farmer, and would be much preferable to the perplexing state of
the law, as it then stood.&nbsp; They also prayed generally for
the relaxation of all commercial restrictions.</p>
<p>1823&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 30&mdash;Meeting
in Worcester, William Wall, Esq., in the chair, at which a
petition to Parliament, praying for the abolition of Negro
Slavery in the British colonies, was agreed upon.&nbsp; One was
also forwarded from Evesham at this time.</p>
<p>1828&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 20&mdash;Public
meeting in the Guildhall, Worcester, with the Mayor in the chair,
at which petitions were agreed to, praying for restrictions on
the importation of foreign gloves.</p>
<p>1828&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 7&mdash;Public
meeting in the Guildhall, for the purpose of establishing an
Infant School in Worcester.&nbsp; The Mayor (James Fletcher,
Esq.) presided; and there were on the platform the Lord Bishop of
Rochester, Dean of Worcester, Rev. C. Benson, Sir A. Lechmere,
Bart., W. Wall, E. Isaac, J. P. Lavender, Esqs., Dr. Hastings,
Mr. Henry Newman, Mr. Josiah Newman, &amp;c.&nbsp; A considerable
subscription was entered into, and the school was established in
Friar Street, where it still exists.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>1828&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>
27&mdash;A meeting at the Guildhall, Worcester, convened by the
&ldquo;City and County Brunswick Club,&rdquo; of those &ldquo;who
were friendly to its political principles,&rdquo; for the purpose
of increasing the number of its members.&nbsp; The general
public, however, assembled in large numbers, and the opposition,
principally, took possession of the Nisi Prius Court.&nbsp; The
Brunswickers thereupon went into the Crown Court, and left Mr.
Payne, Roman Catholic, to harangue the company in the Nisi Prius
Court upon the unfairness of the proceeding.&nbsp; In the Crown
Court, Major Bund was called to the chair, and read the address
and resolutions of the Brunswick Club, with a view of obtaining
&ldquo;the concurrence and support of those who might be friendly
to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He proceeded, amidst mingled cheers and
hisses, to propose petitions to the King and Parliament, praying
that no concession might be made to Catholics.&nbsp; Mr. Richard
Spooner endeavoured to put an amendment, but was told that he had
no right there unless friendly to the principles of the Brunswick
Club, and a show of hands was taken whether he should be
heard.&nbsp; The chairman having decided that it was against Mr.
Spooner, he retired, and the other resolutions were proposed by
Dr. Beale Cooper, E. Burroughs, Esq., John Phillips, Esq., and
carried without much opposition.&nbsp; On the suggestion of the
Rev. Mr. Havergal, three cheers were given at the close of the
meeting for Protestant ascendancy.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Mr. Spooner,
in the body of the hall, and Mr. Foster, of Evesham, in the Nisi
Prius Court, proposed resolutions to the people unable to get
into the Crown Court, declaring the Brunswick Club to be
unnecessary and uncalled for&mdash;and these were carried by
acclamation.&nbsp; The Brunswickers&rsquo; petition received
about 700 signatures on the day of meeting.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 2&mdash;County
meeting, presided over by John Scott, Esq., High Sheriff, for two
objects&mdash;first, to consider the question of erecting a Shire
Hall; and, secondly, to petition Parliament on the subject of
agricultural distress.</p>
<p>As to the first matter, John Williams, Esq., moved a
resolution requesting the magistrates to be satisfied with
alterations and additions to the city Guildhall.&nbsp; This was
seconded by Richard Spooner, Esq.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Pearson
proposed, as an amendment, that the county ought to erect courts
suitable to its respectability, but that the measure should be
postponed till the depression of the agricultural interest had
passed over.&nbsp; Dr. B. Cooper seconded this.&nbsp; Sir C. S.
Smith and R. Spooner, Esq., supported the original proposition,
which was carried almost unanimously.</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Colonel
Lygon having briefly addressed the meeting, warning them not to
regard Parliamentary Reform as a panacea for their ills, Richard
Spooner, Esq., rose and proposed a petition for the adoption of
the meeting: it complained, in the first place, of extravagant
salaries to placemen, and next of the standard of currency to
which the county had been obliged to return by Mr. Peel&rsquo;s
act, and prayed for a thorough reform in Parliament as the only
means of setting these things right.&nbsp; Mr. Spooner bitterly
inveighed against the corruption of the Parliament as it then
existed.&nbsp; The petition was seconded by Charles Hanford,
Esq.&nbsp; Sir C. Smith, Major General Marriott, Dr. B. Cooper,
and J. Williams, Esq., agreed with all the statements of the
petition; but did not want reform, and begged Mr. Spooner to put
it into a separate petition by itself.&nbsp; Mr. S. refused, and
the petition was carried almost unanimously.&nbsp; It afterwards
received 2,180 signatures.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span>
13&mdash;Meeting held in Worcester to form an &ldquo;Agricultural
Society,&rdquo; and to adopt such other measures as might be
deemed expedient in the present depressed state of the
agricultural interest.&nbsp; Charles Hanford, Esq., was called to
the chair.&nbsp; The Rev. H. Berry moved a petition to
Parliament, praying for inquiry into the causes of distress, for
economy and revision of the poor laws, and for a salutary reform
of Parliament.&nbsp; F. Holland, Esq., of Cropthorne, seconded
the adoption of the petition.&nbsp; Mr. Allen objected to the
&ldquo;Reform&rdquo; part of the business, and suggested that a
county meeting should be called.&nbsp; This was agreed to, and a
requisition to the High Sheriff immediately prepared.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Agricultural Society,&rdquo; however, was formed.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 6&mdash;County
meeting, to vote addresses of condolence and congratulation to
His Majesty King William IV, on the death of his brother and his
accession to the throne.&nbsp; John Scott, Esq., High Sheriff, in
the chair.&nbsp; The addresses were moved by Lord Deerhurst, and
seconded by Sir Anthony Lechmere, Bart.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span>
13&mdash;Anti-Slavery meeting at the Guildhall; Dr. Hastings in
the chair.&nbsp; The speakers were the Rev. John Davies, the Rev.

of Martley, the Rev. George Redford, J. W. Isaac, Esq., the Rev.
John Brown, Mr. Stanley Pumphrey, and the Rev. Mr. Bell of
Knightwick.&nbsp; Both the attendance and the speeches were very
respectable.&nbsp; A petition was agreed to, which received 1,826
signatures.&nbsp; <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Petitions were also forwarded to Parliament, about this
time, from every town and many villages of the county.</p>

introduced into the Commons.&nbsp; The Mayor, H. B. Tymbs, Esq.,
refused to call a town&rsquo;s meeting, but left the Guildhall at
the disposal of the requisitionists.&nbsp; On the motion of R.
Spooner, Esq., William Saunders, Esq., was called to the
chair.&nbsp; Mr. Allen moved, and Mr. Deighton seconded, the
first resolution, expressing the gratification of the meeting in
the measures proposed by His Majesty&rsquo;s ministers.&nbsp; The
other speakers were Thomas Scott, Esq., Mr. Daniel George, Mr.
Timings, Dr. Corbett, Mr. George Brook, Mr. Greening, Mr.
Spooner, Mr. Gillam, Mr. Wensley, Mr. Williams, and Mr.

Esq., H. E. Strickland, Esq., R. Berkeley, Esq., W. Welch, Esq.,
W. Acton, Esq., T. C. Hornyold, Esq., T. T. Vernon, Esq., and H.
Bearcroft, Esq.&nbsp; Lord Lyttelton, after the resolutions had
all been carried, addressed the meeting at considerable length,
expressing his delight at having lived to see the day in which
the principles he had advocated through life were, at last, to
obtain a triumph in the wise and salutary measure of Reform
brought forward by the Government.&nbsp; The Hon. T. H. Foley,
M.P., also spoke in favour of the bill.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
30&mdash;Public meeting in the Guildhall, Worcester, of citizens
and others, to petition the House of Lords in favour of the

speakers were Mr. Merryweather Turner, Mr. Curwood, and Mr.
Acton; the other movers and seconders of resolutions being Thomas
Scott, Esq., Mr. G. Brook, Mr. Smith, Mr. Blackwell, Mr. John
Bishop, and Captain Wilson.&nbsp; The hall was crowded and the
proceedings most enthusiastic.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 14&mdash;The
Reform Bill having been rejected by the House of Lords by a
majority of 41, another meeting of the citizens was called in the
Guildhall, Worcester, to vote an address to the King, praying
&ldquo;that he will continue his present confidential

the speakers were much the same as on the previous
occasion.&nbsp; The tone of the meeting <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>was tolerably
moderate.&nbsp; The Worcester Political Union and the
parishioners of All Saints and St. Michael met and agreed to
similar addresses.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 5&mdash;The
county meeting, for a similar purpose, was held this day, Osman

Rev. Mr. Berry, and the Hon. T. H. Foley, M.P.&nbsp; The various

spoke confidently of obtaining reform shortly.&nbsp; Three cheers
were given at the conclusion of the meeting for Lord Lyttelton,
three groans for the Earl of Coventry, three cheers for the King,
three for Earl Grey, Lord Brougham, and Lord Althorp, and three
groans for the Corporation.&nbsp; Some disturbances took place in

procession to the grand stand, headed by flags and a band.&nbsp;
It is said that at least 10,000 persons were present.&nbsp; C.

in the Guildhall, Worcester, to petition the legislature for a

Mr. Pemberton, Mr. Scott, Mr. Williams, Mr. J. Davis, Mr.
Wheeler, &amp;c., moved and seconded the resolutions, which
declared that the house duty was oppressive and especially
obnoxious, because of the power vested in the surveyor who levied
it&mdash;that the window tax was offensive in principle and in
practice&mdash;that they both pressed most heavily on the middle
classes&mdash;who had, indeed, to bear everything&mdash;and that
they ought to be forthwith abolished.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;Meeting
of Dissenters at Kidderminster, Dr. Ross in the chair, to
memorialise Government for the redress of grievances.&nbsp; The
speakers were the Rev. Mr. Fry, Mr. Henry Brinton, Mr. Chadwick,
Rev. Mr. Smith, Rev. Mr. Warren, Rev. Mr. Coles, Mr. W. Brinton,
Mr. Charles Talbot, and Mr. Thomas Hopkins.&nbsp; The memorial
agreed to was directed to Earl Grey, and prayed, first, for
relief from Church Rates; second, the power of celebrating
marriages without conforming to the Church service; third, for
the right of interring their dead in parochial burial grounds by
their own ministers; fourth, the right of admission to the
universities; fifth, for a general system of registering births,
deaths, and marriages, without regard to religious
distinction.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span>
24&mdash;Meeting of laity of the Church of England at
Kidderminster, to express unshaken confidence in the principles
of the Establishment, and to petition Parliament in its
behalf.&nbsp; The meeting was held in the National School-room,
and was numerously attended.&nbsp; Abraham Turner, Esq., was
called to the chair, and the resolutions were proposed by the
High Bailiff, Mr. Samuel Beddoes, Mr. Woodward, churchwarden, Mr.
J. Gough, Mr. Bradley, Mr. George Hooman, Mr. Thomas Hallen, Mr.
Boycot, sen., Mr. Dixon, Mr. Tomkins, and Mr. Harvey.&nbsp; The
resolutions were unanimously adopted.&nbsp; [The Catholic priest,
displeased at some allusion made to his religion at the
Dissenters&rsquo; meeting, declared that he thought a union of
Catholics with the Church of England not at all impossible.]</p>
<p>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 9&mdash;Meeting of
owners and occupiers of land, at the Bell Inn, Worcester,
&ldquo;to consider the propriety of petitioning Parliament on the
ruinous state of the agricultural interest.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>room was very
much crowded; and the Earl of Coventry was called to the
chair.&nbsp; Sir Anthony Lechmere, Bart., moved the adoption of a
petition which attributed the greatest part of agricultural
distress to the alteration of the currency, by the Bill of 1819,
and therefore prayed that Parliament would institute an immediate
inquiry into the effects of that measure.&nbsp; The removal of
&ldquo;the present, though inadequate&rdquo; protection of the
Corn Laws, would certainly accelerate their destruction, which
was daily drawing nearer by reason of the enormous increase of
their various burdens.&nbsp; Earl Beauchamp seconded the adoption
of the petition.&nbsp; Major Bund moved that that part of the
petition which related to the currency should be left out, for
that was a subject into which if they once got they would never
be able to get out again.&nbsp; This called forth a long speech
from Mr. Spooner, &ldquo;going into&rdquo; the currency question
very fully; and the result was that the amendment was withdrawn,
and the petition carried unanimously.&nbsp; The petition had
3,000 signatures attached to it.&nbsp; Mr. T. Attwood, when it
was presented to the House by Colonel Lygon, &ldquo;hailed it
with satisfaction, because it was the first agricultural petition
which traced the distress to its true source&mdash;the Currency
Bill of 1819.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 27&mdash;A meeting
at the Crown Inn, Worcester, to consider the ninetieth clause of
the Municipal Reform Bill, which, it was feared, would prevent
the new town councils from leasing the borough property on
anything like the same terms as the old corporations had
done.&nbsp; John Williams, Esq., was called to the chair.&nbsp;
Mr. John Hill proposed, and Mr. Francis Hooper seconded, a motion
suggesting that a committee should be appointed to inquire in the
proper quarter what was the precise intent of the clause.&nbsp;
Mr. Waters moved, and Mr. G. Allies seconded, as an amendment,
&ldquo;that this meeting, not believing that property, held under
corporation leases, will be depreciated in value, are unwilling
to address the legislature on the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Waters&rsquo;s motion was carried.&nbsp; The Mayor wished only
holders of corporation property to vote, but other parties, who
had thronged the room, insisted on their right to express an
opinion; and the result was regarded as a test of public opinion
in the city, with regard to the bill.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 12&mdash;Meeting
in the Corn Market, Worcester, to address His Majesty on the
subject of the Municipal Reform Bill, requesting him to take
measures to ensure its passing the House of Lords without
mutilation.&nbsp; The Mayor, Mr. Leonard, had refused to grant
the use of the hall.&nbsp; C. H. Hebb, Esq., was called to the
chair; <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and
the speakers were Mr. Carey, Mr. Munn, Mr. Sanders, Mr. C. A.
Helm, Mr. Greening, Mr. E. L. Williams, and Mr. B. Stokes.&nbsp;
A petition to the Commons was also agreed to at this meeting,
begging them not to consent to any alteration of the
measure.&nbsp; It received 6,221 signatures.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
7&mdash;Protestant meeting, in the Guildhall, Worcester, the
alleged object being to disseminate a knowledge of the principles
and practices of Popery, and to promote the great principles of
Protestantism as maintained by the Established Church.&nbsp; The
assembly room was well filled.&nbsp; Richard Spooner, Esq., was
called to the chair.&nbsp; The Rev. Mortimer O&lsquo;Sullivan was
the chief speaker; the others being Sir Matthew Blakeston, Bart.,
Rev. C. Benson, Colonel Taylor, Rev. George Turberville, Rev.
John Cawood, John Brown, Esq., Lea Castle, Dr. B. Cooper, C.
Hawkins, Esq., Samuel Kent, Esq., Rev. W. Chesshyre.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;Protestant Association&rdquo; was determined on, but the
meeting resolved itself, in reality, into an opposition to the
appropriating clauses of the Irish Church Bill, then before the
Lords.&nbsp; This meeting was the occasion of a correspondence
between Mr. Hanford and Mr. Spooner, and a whole host of general
letters in the newspapers.&nbsp; The Rev. T. M&lsquo;Donnell came
from Birmingham on purpose to preach about it at the Catholic
Chapel.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
26&mdash;Meeting of the Worcestershire Agricultural Society, at
the Crown Inn, Worcester, numerously attended.&nbsp; Sir A.
Lechmere, Bart., the president for the year, in the chair.&nbsp;
It was first resolved that agriculturists had waited long enough
for the amelioration of their condition, which, according to a
committee of the Commons in 1833, was to result from &ldquo;the
cautious forbearance rather than the active interposition of
Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; That it was necessary the agricultural
body should be roused into energy to prevent the &ldquo;total
ruin impending over both landlords and tenants.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
Government were remitting all sorts of taxes to the manufacturing
interests, and none to them&mdash;and, then, that it was highly
desirable that the question of the currency should be brought
under the serious attention of Parliament; as the sudden
reduction of the amount of circulating medium had been one of the
chief causes of the ruinous prices of agricultural produce.&nbsp;
It would also be a great relief to the farmer to be allowed to
malt grain, the produce of his own farm, duty free.&nbsp; The
Marquis of Chandos was accepted as the farmers&rsquo; champion;
and he was to be urged to bring these matters before Parliament,
these being the only remedies suggested.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 17&mdash;Meeting
of the agriculturists of the county at <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the Crown Inn, Broad Street, to
consider the distress and ruinous condition of the agricultural
interest.&nbsp; Sir A. Lechmere, Bart., was called to the
chair.&nbsp; Mr. Spooner moved an address to the King, setting
forth the distress of the farmers, and suggesting that there
ought to be an alteration of the standard of value to relieve
them&mdash;they ought, also, to be allowed to malt their own
grain.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson, M.P., Captain Winnington, M.P., and
Mr. Pakington, M.P., were very averse to mixing up the currency
question with agricultural distress, and had a long argument with
Mr. Spooner thereon.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson had voted for repeal of
the malt tax, but would never consent to one set of men only
being exempt from the excise laws.&nbsp; The address, as it
originally stood, was carried by a large majority.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span>
30&mdash;Town&rsquo;s meeting at the Guildhall, Worcester, to
agree to an address to His Majesty&rsquo;s ministers, and a
petition to the House of Commons, in favour of the Irish
Municipal Reform Bill.&nbsp; The Mayor, C. H. Hebb, Esq., was in
the chair; and there was a numerous gathering of citizens.&nbsp;
Mr. Acton, Mr. Hanford, Mr. Alderman Gibbs, Mr. Sheriff Allies,
Mr. Alderman R. Evans, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Carey, Mr. Parry, Mr.
Greening, Mr. Chapman, and Mr. Southan were the speakers.&nbsp;
The proceedings were unanimous.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 30&mdash;Meeting in
the Guildhall, Worcester, to form a &ldquo;Worcester Reform
Association;&rdquo; the principal object alleged being to look
after the registration.&nbsp; Mr. Robert Hardy was called to the
chair, and the hall was crowded with operatives and others.&nbsp;
The meeting was addressed by Captain Corles, Mr. F. T. Elgie,
Colonel Davies, and others.&nbsp; G. Munn, Esq., was elected
president of the new association.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 26&mdash;Meeting
in Worcester Town Hall, to petition for Vote by Ballot.&nbsp; The
meeting had, first of all, been called for the Thursday previous,
but the requisitionists having determined to postpone it, the
Mayor left the hall.&nbsp; A number of the Conservative party
were left waiting in the Crown Court, and not having been
properly apprised of the adjournment, they, after a little
interval, called Major Bund to the chair.&nbsp; Mr. Gutch and Mr.
F. Hooper moved a petition condemning the ballot, which was
declared to &ldquo;lead to the corruption of public morals by the
general practice of treachery and hypocrisy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was carried by a large majority.&nbsp; Mr. Gutch and Mr. Lingham
then moved that &ldquo;the conduct of the Mayor and the
requisitionists in not attending the meeting, and not offering
any explanation of their absence, was an insult to the citizens
of Worcester, and highly censurable;&rdquo; and this also met
with the approval of the <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>parties present.&nbsp; These
proceedings of course only made the original promoters of the
meeting more in earnest, and the hall was this day crowded by a
company entirely unanimous in favour of the ballot.&nbsp; The
Mayor was in the chair; and the various resolutions and petitions
were moved by Mr. F. T. Elgie, Secretary to the Worcester Reform
Association, W. Acton, Esq., Mr. Hardy, Mr. Arrowsmith, Mr. John
Hill, Town Clerk, Mr. Raby, C. Hanford, Esq., Mr. Alderman
Corles, Mr. John Hall, &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. Waters asserted that he
had told Major Bund, half an hour before the meeting of the
previous week, that it was postponed.&nbsp; The ballot was
declared, in the petition adopted by the meeting, to be
&ldquo;essentially necessary to the purity of
election.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 30&mdash;Meeting
of the clergy of the diocese, at the Chapter House, to petition
against the Church Rate Bill, then lately introduced by
ministers.&nbsp; The Venerable Archdeacon Onslow was in the
chair.&nbsp; The Rev. John Peel, Rev. T. Baker, Rev. John Foley,
Rev. J. R. Gray, Rev. C. Benson, Rev. R. B. Hone, Rev. A. B.
Lechmere, Rev. H. Hastings, Rev. E. W. Wakeman, and the Hon. and
Rev. J. S. Cocks moved or seconded the resolutions.&nbsp; The
tone of the speeches generally was moderate; but the Tithe
Commutation Act was included in the animadversions of the
speakers, as well as the bill for abolishing church rates.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 5&mdash;Public
meeting at Worcester, to consider the best means of alleviating
the distress existing amongst the operative glovers.&nbsp; The
Mayor, C. H. Hebb, Esq., was in the chair.&nbsp; John Dent, Esq.,
Dr. Hastings, Mr. S. Pumphrey, E. H. Lechmere, Esq., John
Williams, Esq., W. Wall, Esq., Mr. Tymbs, Mr. Lavender, R.
Berkeley, Esq., and Mr. T. Newman moved the various
resolutions.&nbsp; The distress was not traced further, as to its
causes, than the decay of trade and want of orders.&nbsp; Many
hundreds of families had applied for relief.&nbsp; It was
determined that a general subscription should be entered into,
and a committee of master glovers was appointed to scrutinise the
applications for charity.&nbsp; About &pound;1,000 was collected,
including &pound;100 from the Earl of Coventry, &pound;50 from
Earl Beauchamp, and &pound;30 from a performance at the Theatre,
given for this purpose by Mr. Bennett.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span>
18&mdash;Anti-Slavery meeting at the Guildhall, to hear an
address from Mr. Joseph Sturge, on the apprenticeship
system.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman R. Evans was called to the
chair.&nbsp; Dr. Redford, Mr. Stanley Pumphrey, Rev. Thomas
Waters, and Mr. Brewin moved resolutions declaring for total
abolition; and pledging the meeting only to support such
candidates, at the next election, as would vote <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>for such a
step.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson and Colonel Davies gave the meeting
satisfactory assurances.&nbsp; Mr. Bailey was not present, but
Mr. Gutch read a note from him.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 10&mdash;County
meeting held at the Guildhall, Worcester, to congratulate Queen
Victoria on her ascension to the throne, and to condole with the
Queen Dowager on her bereavement.&nbsp; The High Sheriff, W.
Roberts, Esq., was in the chair.&nbsp; The Earl of Coventry moved
the addresses; and the Bishop of Worcester seconded the one, and
the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Foley, the other.&nbsp; Earl Coventry
was requested to present them.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>
20&mdash;Meeting of the clergy in the Chapter House, the Ven.
Archdeacon Onslow in the chair.&nbsp; Addresses to Her Majesty, a
memorial to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and petitions to
Parliament were adopted against certain clauses in the Marriage
and Registration Acts, against the Tithe Commutation Act, and
against the constitution of the Ecclesiastical Commission.&nbsp;
The Revs. T. Baker, C. Dunne, Hon. J. S. Cocks, A. B. Lechmere,
G. W. Kershaw, C. Benson, R. B. Hone, J. F. Turner, W. R. Holden,
and W. A. Pruen, moved or seconded the resolutions.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>
30&mdash;Anti-Slavery meeting in the Town Hall, to petition for
the immediate abolition of the apprenticeship system.&nbsp; Mr.
Stanley Pumphrey was in the chair.&nbsp; The speakers
were&mdash;Dr. Redford, Mr. Bowly, Mr. George Thompson (London),
Mr. S. Burden, Mr. Alderman R. Evans, Mr. Ledbrook, and Mr. B.
Stokes.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 6&mdash;Common
hall at Worcester, to petition for the ballot.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman
Hebb took the chair.&nbsp; The movers of the resolutions
were&mdash;William Acton, Esq., Mr. Arrowsmith, Mr. Elgie, Mr.
James Wall, Charles Hanford, Esq., Mr. Greening, Mr. Edward
Hooper, and Mr. George.&nbsp; A Mr. Davis, a native of Worcester,
but who had resided a considerable time in the United States,
said the ballot had not worked well there.&nbsp; Colonel Davies
and Mr. Turton, the expectant candidate, afterwards addressed the
meeting.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
11&mdash;Meeting of citizens at the Guildhall, at which it was
resolved that an act should be applied for to obtain powers for
the better regulation and repair of the streets and highways
within the borough.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint proposed that the powers
under such act should rest in the City Commissioners, and Mr.
Deighton moved, as an amendment, that they should lie in the
Council.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint&rsquo;s resolution was carried; and,
further, that the qualification of a Commissioner should be
reduced to an <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>income of &pound;20 a year.&nbsp; In consequence of this
decision the Council refused to proceed further with the
bill.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 23&mdash;County
meeting, in the New Shire Hall, on the Corn Law question.&nbsp;
The High Sheriff, Mr. Russell, presided.&nbsp; The outer hall was
completely filled, and the minority of Corn Law repealers were
very noisy.&nbsp; The first resolution, proposed by the Earl of
Coventry, and seconded by William Acton, Esq., was as follows:
&ldquo;That taking into consideration the natural and artificial
causes which produce variations in the price of corn, and which
experience has proved it is beyond the power of human legislation
at all times to obviate or control, and looking at the slight
changes in prices which have occurred since the last corn act was
passed, which, while it regulates the duties on importation,
affords protection to the home grower&mdash;this meeting is of
opinion that it would be unjust and impolitic to make any
alteration in the principle of the present law.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
remaining resolutions were merely routine, and were moved or
seconded by Sir Offley Wakeman, Bart., O. Mason, Esq., Hon. W.
Coventry, George Allies, Esq. (Mayor of Worcester), John Freeman,
Esq., Sir A. Lechmere, Bart., Earl Beauchamp, and General Lygon,
M.P.&nbsp; They were all carried by very large majorities.&nbsp;
Towards the close of the meeting the uproar was very
considerable, and at last, on the interposition of the Earl of
Coventry, Mr. F. H. Coates, though not a freeholder, was allowed
to speak in favour of a repeal of the Corn Laws, and was heard
with considerable attention.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 6&mdash;Large
meeting of the clergy and laity of the Church of England held in
the Crown Court, New Shire Hall, to form a Diocesan Board of
Education in connection with the National School Society.&nbsp;
The Lord Bishop took the chair, and the Rev. Donald Cameron read
a report of a committee which had been previously appointed on
the subject.&nbsp; Archdeacon Spooner, Sir John Mordaunt, Bart.,
M.P., Prebendary Digby, Mr. Pakington, and Canon Benson were the
principal speakers, and moved resolutions pledging the meeting to
form such a society as was suggested, and vigorously to support
it.&nbsp; A training school for teachers was especially
mentioned.&nbsp; Handsome donations were given on the spot.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 27&mdash;The first
Anti-Corn-Law meeting held in Worcester.&nbsp; It was a gathering
of operatives, and took place in the Town Hall.&nbsp; Mr. John
Richardson, ironfounder, was called to the chair; and the
speakers were Mr. Robert Hardy, Mr. Thomas Waters, and several
operatives, by whom indeed the meeting was convened.&nbsp; <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>A petition,
praying for a total repeal of the Corn Laws, was unanimously
agreed to.&nbsp; The meeting was held with the view of
strengthening Mr. Villiers&rsquo;s hands in an approaching
debate, and the number of signatures attached to the petition was
3,326.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 29&mdash;County
meeting, with the High Sheriff in the chair, to address the Queen
on her escape from the attempt at assassination by Oxford.&nbsp;
The resolutions were moved by Sir A. Lechmere, Mr. Pakington,
Lord Southwell, Colonel Davies, Dr. B. Cooper, and the Hon. and
Rev. W. W. C. Talbot.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 15&mdash;Public
meeting in the Guildhall, Worcester, to vote congratulatory
addresses to the Queen and Prince Albert on the birth of the
Prince of Wales.&nbsp; The Mayor, Edward Evans, Esq., presided;
and the resolutions were moved by the Lord Bishop of Worcester,
John Williams, Esq., Sir A. Lechmere, Bart., Captain Thomas,
&amp;c.&nbsp; A subscription was entered into to supply the poor
of the city with coal at a reduced rate, and this was called the
Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Coal Fund&mdash;&pound;1,021 were raised
by this means.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 23&mdash;A
common hall convened at Worcester, to consider the distress of
the country.&nbsp; The requisition had been taken round for
signature by Mr. J. D. Stevenson, and a great number of persons
had affixed their names.&nbsp; The hall was densely filled with
operatives, and the proceedings were commenced by Mr. R. Hardy,
who moved a resolution declaring that the distress of the country
could be traced to &ldquo;the Corn Laws and other restrictions on
the trade and liberties of the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
seconded by Mr. Edward Webb, and every hand was held up in its
favour, save one.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Corles proposed another
resolution, declaring that the Corn Laws never would have been
enacted if the people had been fully represented in Parliament,
and that all bad statutes had arisen from class
legislation.&nbsp; This was seconded by Mr. Alderman Padmore, and
carried unanimously.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie moved the third
resolution&mdash;that the present Parliament was not the
people&rsquo;s Parliament, and that it was necessary for the
operative and middle classes to unite for the overthrow of
monopolies.&nbsp; This was seconded by Mr. Fisher; but a
Chartist, named Davie, moved an amendment&mdash;&ldquo;that the
principles of the People&rsquo;s Charter should be embodied in
the petition;&rdquo; this was seconded by an operative named
Williams, and two Birmingham Chartists, named Young and Mason,
wanted to speak to the amendment; but the Mayor would not let
them, because this was a &ldquo;town&rsquo;s meeting&rdquo; and
they were strangers.&nbsp; This caused great uproar; so he put
the matter to the meeting, and requested those who were of <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>opinion that
the people of Worcester could manage their own affairs, to go to
the right&mdash;and those who thought they were not competent so
to do, to the left.&nbsp; This but increased the disturbance, and
the Mayor put the question in the usual method; and, whether by
mistake or not, the great majority declared that strangers should
not be heard.&nbsp; The Mayor then put the amendment in favour of
the Charter, and two-thirds of the meeting held up their hands in
its favour.&nbsp; Davie then moved the adoption of the
&ldquo;National Petition,&rdquo; praying for universal suffrage,
repeal of the union, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The Mayor
objected that this was not put as the petition of the people of
Worcester.&nbsp; Dr. Redford made an attempt to convince the
operatives of their mistake in creating disunion, but after a few
sentences he gave up the task.&nbsp; The Mayor declined to put
the National Petition; and after asking whether any gentleman had
anything else to propose, he declared the meeting dissolved, and
left the hustings.&nbsp; The Chartists remained in the hall, and
having moved Mr. Stevenson into the chair, Mason and Whyte made
long orations, especially abusive of the Mayor, and the National
Petition was carried by acclamation.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 16&mdash;A
numerous meeting of the agriculturists, held at the Crown Inn, to
consider Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s New Tariff.&nbsp; P. V. Onslow,
Esq., in the chair.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler, Mr. Williams, and others
thought they had not sufficient information before them to go
upon, and expressed confidence in Sir Robert Peel.&nbsp; Mr.
Woodward moved a series of resolutions, stating that the proposed
alterations would seriously injure the agriculturists, and they
could have no confidence in any ministry who proposed them.&nbsp;
Mr. Benson moved a resolution somewhat milder, but deprecating
the reduction of duty on cattle, &amp;c., and this was carried by
a considerable majority.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 13&mdash;Public
meeting in the Guildhall, Worcester, John Lilly, Esq., Mayor,
presiding, to petition against the tenth article of the Ashburton
treaty; which, in providing for the extradition of criminals from
Canada to the United States, was thought likely to interfere with
the liberty of escaped slaves.&nbsp; The resolutions were moved
by Dr. Redford, Alderman E. Evans, Rev. Mr. Holden, Rev. J.
Earnshaw, Mr. G. Grove, Rev. C. Lee, &amp;c.; and Sir Thomas
Wilde was requested to present the petition.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 27&mdash;Public
meeting at the Bell Hotel, to form an Agricultural Protection
Society for Worcestershire.&nbsp; P. V. Onslow, Esq., took the
chair; and the resolutions were moved by Mr. F. Woodward, Sir
Anthony Lechmere, Dr. B. Cooper, Mr. Henry <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Hudson, J. S.
Pakington, Esq., M.P., Mr. Onley, Mr. Curtler, Mr. James Taylor,
and the Hon. and Rev. W. W. C. Talbot.&nbsp; The meeting was
attended by about 300 farmers and landowners, and about
&pound;550 were subscribed on the spot.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 4&mdash;A
meeting of the medical profession of the county, convened in the
board room of the Worcester Infirmary, for the purpose of
considering the provisions of the Medical Bill introduced in the
late session of Parliament by Sir James Graham.&nbsp; Dr. Malden
was called to the chair; and Mr. Pierpoint, and Mr. Davis of
Pershore, moved a resolution approving of the bill in
general.&nbsp; Dr. Hastings, and Mr. A. Martin of Evesham, moved
a second, declaring that the bill was defective in not containing
a clause for the punishment of unqualified and unregistered
practitioners, and that it was the duty of every medical man to
oppose the bill unless such a clause were inserted.&nbsp; A
petition was agreed to, praying for the insertion of such a
protective clause.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 28&mdash;A
town&rsquo;s meeting called at Droitwich, to consider the
proposal of the Patent Salt Company to carry their brine down to
Camp by means of pipes, and convert it into salt there, so as to
save the great expense of tonnage on the Droitwich Canal.&nbsp;
The Mayor, T. G. Smith, Esq., presided.&nbsp; The meeting
unanimously agreed to petition against the proposed measure, as
one which would be utterly destructive of the trade of the
borough.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler, in moving the second resolution, went
at length into the whole matter, attributing the Salt
Company&rsquo;s want of success to their own mismanagement; and
he blamed them for seeking to monopolise the whole trade in their
own hands.&nbsp; At the same time he admitted that they had a
right to complain of the heavy charges imposed by the Canal
Company, who fancied themselves bound by the guarantee given them
by the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company to give them
&pound;8 interest per share, to keep the tolls up to the
<i>maximum</i> of 3d. a mile per ton.&nbsp; But he said the Canal
Company were about to take steps to alter this state of
things.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington, who attended the meeting to learn
the wishes of his constituents, said he should give the Salt
Company&rsquo;s measure his most strenuous opposition in
Parliament.&nbsp; The scheme was shortly afterwards
abandoned.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 16&mdash;A
public meeting held in the Guildhall, Worcester, to consider what
steps should be taken for the relief of the poor in the city
during the winter, which had commenced with much severity.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Rochester took the chair; and it was unanimously
resolved that the balance left from the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Coal Fund
should be increased by a general subscription, and another
distribution of coal, blankets, &amp;c., take place.&nbsp; Mr.
Mence suggested that the funds should be distributed by the
Visiting Society; but it was discovered that this had recently
become entirely a Church of England society, and Dr. Redford
protested against any general fund therefore being committed to
its charge.&nbsp; A committee, upon which all the Dissenting
ministers of the city were placed, was appointed by the meeting
for the distribution of the funds.&nbsp; The subscriptions
amounted to &pound;702. 17s.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 27&mdash;The
Agricultural Protection Society held a general meeting at the
Crown Hotel, Broad Street, Worcester; P. V. Onslow, Esq., in the
chair.&nbsp; The speakers were Mr. F. Woodward, Mr. Lucy, J. S.
Pakington, Esq., M.P., Mr. Curtler, the Hon. W. Coventry, Mr.
Gutch, and Mr. Whittaker.&nbsp; The proximate causes for calling
the meeting were&mdash;Lord John Russell&rsquo;s letter avowing
himself a total repealer, and the certainty that some measures
affecting the agricultural interest would be brought forward by
Sir Robert Peel in the ensuing session.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler avowed
that he believed Sir Robert Peel to be an honest statesman, who
had no motive for injuring the agricultural interest, and never
would think of doing such a thing.&nbsp; The resolutions pledged
the Society to carry out &ldquo;a well-digested mode of
action&rdquo; against repeal of the Corn Laws.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 29&mdash;A
town&rsquo;s meeting held at Worcester, to consider the New Gas
Company&rsquo;s Bill; William Lewis, Esq., Mayor,
presiding.&nbsp; There had been many complaints of the bad
quality of the gas supplied by the Old Company, and murmurs were
heard about the price charged; in consequence of which, some
parties thought it would answer their purpose to project a new
set of works.&nbsp; The Old Company thereupon reduced the price
from 8s. 4d. to 7s. 6d. per 1,000 feet; but this was only taken
as an admission that the price ought to have been less before,
and the New Company&rsquo;s project went on and a great deal of
ill feeling was excited&mdash;the popular cry, of course, being
raised against that which had been a good while established, and
was supposed to have been a source of considerable emolument to
the parties engaged.&nbsp; That it had not been so to the
shareholders was proved, but it was thereupon retorted that the
management had been bad, and that the lessee of the works had
made a fortune by them, &amp;c.&nbsp; Negociations were at one
time opened for the sale of the Old Company&rsquo;s works to the
New, but these fell through; and the New Company being now about
to bring their bill before Parliament, it was necessary <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>that they
should have the approval of the town to back them.&nbsp; Mr.
Pierpoint, at this meeting, elaborately stated the case on the
New Company&rsquo;s behalf; and Mr. H. B. Tymbs (chairman of the
Old Company), Mr. Jones (their new manager), Mr. Francis Hooper,
Mr. John Hill, and Mr. Bedford spoke for the Old Company.&nbsp; A
petition in favour of the New Company&rsquo;s bill, proposed by
Mr. W. D. Lingham and Mr. Barnett, was carried by a majority of
three to one.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 24&mdash;The Mayor
of Worcester, Mr. Elgie, convened a public meeting in the
Guildhall, for the purpose of considering the steps that should
be taken to relieve the poor of the city, who were suffering much
from the then high price of provisions.&nbsp; The meeting was
most respectably attended by men of all parties, and more than
&pound;300 was at once collected for the purpose of furnishing
the poor with provisions at a cheap rate.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 26&mdash;Public
meeting of the inhabitants of Worcester, to petition against the
Government proposal to increase the Income Tax per centage.&nbsp;
The Mayor, E. Webb, Esq., presided, and Mr. Gutch, Mr. Alderman
Elgie, Mr. F. H. Needham, Mr. Manning, Mr. Arrowsmith, Mr. John
Hood, Mr. Pierpoint, and Mr. Bedford moved or seconded the
resolutions.&nbsp; F. Rufford, Esq., M.P., also spoke.&nbsp; In
consequence of demonstrations like these throughout the country,
the Government proposition to levy a three per cent. permanent
income tax was abandoned.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 16&mdash;A
town&rsquo;s meeting, held at Worcester, to petition in favour of
&ldquo;further reform.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mayor, Mr. Webb,
presided; and Mr. R. Hardy and Mr. J. Wall moved the first
resolution&mdash;declaring that the present representation of the
people in the House of Commons was partial, &amp;c.; and this was
carried almost unanimously.&nbsp; Mr. Arrowsmith and Mr. Everett
moved a petition in favour of Mr. Hume&rsquo;s motion for
extension of the suffrage to all householders, triennial
Parliaments, ballot, and equal apportionment of members to the
population.&nbsp; John Dinmore Stephenson moved a petition for
the whole &ldquo;six points&rdquo; in amendment, but after twice
calling for a show of hands the Mayor declared the amendment to
be lost, though it was a very near thing.&nbsp; The other
resolutions were moved by the Rev. William Crowe, Mr. Alderman E.
Evans, &amp;c., and carried without opposition.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 5&mdash;County
meeting, held at the Shire Hall, Worcester, to consider the
distress under which the agricultural body were then said to be
labouring.&nbsp; The High Sheriff, John Dent, Esq., occupied the
chair; and the meeting was most numerously and <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>respectably
attended.&nbsp; James Taylor, Esq., of Moseley Hall, moved the
first resolution&mdash;expressing alarm at the depression under
which both the agricultural and manufacturing interests of the
county were suffering.&nbsp; Mr. Joseph Stallard seconded this
resolution.&nbsp; Mr. James Baldwin, paper manufacturer, of
Birmingham, proposed an amendment, which, while it admitted the
depression in trade and agriculture, suggested a remedy in the
reduction of taxation, and chiefly from a repeal of the malt and
hop duties.&nbsp; Mr. George Baker seconded the resolution.&nbsp;
Mr. Laslett, addressed the meeting from the gallery, declaring
that there was no possibility of any return to Protection, and
that a reduction of rent was what was wanted.&nbsp; Mr. Laslett
concluded his observations by saying, &ldquo;You should have sent
men to Parliament who would have taken care of your interest and
not have sold you,&rdquo; at which, as through his speech, there
was great uproar.&nbsp; The resolution was carried with
comparative few dissentients.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler then
moved&mdash;&ldquo;That the free trade measures of 1846 are
partial and unjust in their operation&mdash;are inconsistent with
the burdened interests of this country&mdash;must render abortive
the utmost efforts of British industry to struggle against the
unequal competition to which it is exposed, and which (if the
present free trade measures are continued) will involve all
classes in one common ruin.&rdquo;&nbsp; This resolution he
supported in a long and clever speech, endeavouring to show the
preponderance of the agricultural over the manufacturing
interest, and inveighing against Sir Robert Peel for his
treachery to the agricultural party.&nbsp; The loss to the
farmer, by the removal of Protection, he declared could not be
made up to him, even if he was set free from paying any rent at
all.&nbsp; The Rev. John Pearson seconded the resolution,
declaring that, though he had been accustomed to take what was
called a liberal line of politics, he was compelled to advocate
Protection from a conviction that the farmers had not been fairly
dealt with.&nbsp; The other resolutions were moved or seconded by
Mr. J. R. Cookes, Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Francis Woodward, and Mr.
Henry Hudson, and were all carried unanimously.&nbsp; Sir John
Pakington afterwards addressed the meeting at great length,
saying that, though he had voted against the repeal of the corn
laws, and still continued to think that a very dangerous measure,
yet free trade must have a trial.&nbsp; He did not think things
quite so gloomy as his friends had represented them to
be&mdash;prices had been lower even in days of Protection, and he
was not inclined to increase the panic which prevailed.&nbsp; He
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>recommended that they should demand from Parliament a
redistribution of local taxation.&nbsp; Mr. Whittaker, amidst
great cheering, begged the meeting not to be led away by the
speech they had just heard; they must stick to Protection and not
seek after a score of other things.&nbsp; General Lygon, M.P.,
and Captain Rushout, M.P., declared their firm adhesion to the
principles of Protection.</p>
<p>1850&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 19&mdash;A
county meeting, in compliance with a requisition most numerously
signed by agriculturists, was held in the Crown Court of the
Shire Hall, in favour of Protection.&nbsp; John Dent, Esq., the
High Sheriff, being indisposed, the chair was taken by the Hon.
W. Coventry.&nbsp; The first resolution, declaring that the
abandonment of Protection had involved large classes of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, as well manufacturing as agricultural,
in distress and ruin, was moved by James Taylor, Esq., and
seconded by T. G. Curtler, Esq.; but before Mr. Curtler could
conclude, such vehement cries, for adjournment into the outer
hall, arose, that the proceedings were entirely
interrupted.&nbsp; The chairman declined to adjourn, and the free
traders, in the principal gallery, maintained such a continual
uproar that all the rest of the proceedings passed in dumb
show.&nbsp; The other resolutions and petitions were moved or
seconded by Mr. Cookes, Mr. Henry Hudson, the Rev. John Pearson,
Mr. Best, M.P., the Hon. and Rev. W. W. C. Talbot, Mr. F.
Holland, &amp;c., and were carried by large majorities in the
midst of great noise.</p>
<p>1850&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 16&mdash;A
meeting of the clergy of the Archdeaconry of Worcester, attended
by about 200 of the clerical body, held in the Chapter House, to
protest against the Papal Aggression.&nbsp; The Venerable
Archdeacon Hone presided, and opened the meeting in a temperate
speech.&nbsp; Canon Wood moved an address to Her Majesty,
declaring that the Bishop of Rome had invaded the Queen&rsquo;s
prerogative by appointing archbishops and bishops here with
titles taken from English cities and towns&mdash;assuring Her
Majesty of their attachment to the principles of the
Reformation&mdash;and, also, that they would support her in the
discharge of the solemn obligations of her coronation oath to
maintain the Protestant religion and the rights of the bishops
and clergy.&nbsp; The Rev. R. Seymour, rector of Kinwarton,
seconded the address, declaring that the Bishop of Rome had been
guilty of a schismatical act, and had invaded the unity of the
Church by appointing bishops in this country.&nbsp; The Rev. J.
F. Mackarness, vicar of Tardebigg, protested at length against
the meeting adopting this course.&nbsp; They would appear to be
asking the help of the civil <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>power against the intrusion of Rome,
and that would be most unwise.&nbsp; The Church of England was
already too much open to the taunt of being a law-made church;
and the only true way of conserving and extending their influence
as clergy was by earnestness of faith and devotion in
labour.&nbsp; The address was, however, carried without other
dissent.&nbsp; The remaining resolutions were moved by the Rev.
H. J. Hastings, the Hon. and Rev. W. H. Lyttelton, the Rev. H.
Woodgate, and the Hon. and Rev. W. W. C. Talbot.</p>
<p>1850&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 18&mdash;A city
meeting held in the Guildhall, Worcester, on the subject of the
Papal Aggression; the Mayor, Mr. Hughes, in the chair.&nbsp; Sir
E. H. Lechmere and Mr. Gutch moved the first resolution, which
declared that the Pope&rsquo;s appointment of bishops in England,
with territorial titles, was &ldquo;an act of aggression justly
calling forth the indignation of every true Protestant, and ought
to be met with the most determined resistance which our laws will
sanction.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Dent, Esq., then moved an address to
Her Majesty; but the meeting was fast falling into confusion, and
was indulging in speculations about the use and propriety of
bishops in general, when Dr. Redford came forward to second the
address, and by his speech procured the unanimous carrying of the
address.&nbsp; The other resolutions were proposed by F. Hooper,
Esq., Henry Aldrich, Esq., H. B. Tymbs, Esq., and W. Dent,
Esq.&nbsp; The parishioners of St. John&rsquo;s parish also
protested against the aggression, in vestry meeting.</p>
<p>1850&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 14&mdash;The
county meeting on the subject of the Papal Aggression was held
this day in the Shire Hall, having been convened by the High
Sheriff in compliance with a requisition signed by 700
persons.&nbsp; Mr. Watkins, the High Sheriff, presided.&nbsp;
James Taylor, Esq., and the Hon. Gen. Lygon, M.P., moved an
address to Her Majesty, declaring the measures of the Pope to be
&ldquo;an assumption of authority over this kingdom&mdash;an
invasion of Her Majesty&rsquo;s supremacy&mdash;an attack on the
liberties and independence of the Church of England&mdash;and an
important advance in the attempt to reimpose the doctrines and
jurisdiction of the Roman Church upon the people of this
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Edward Blount, Bart., and Robert
Berkeley, jun., Esq., moved a counter address, declaring that the
appointment of a Roman Catholic Hierarchy did not require any
legislative interference, and deprecating all restrictions upon
the free enjoyment, by every religious body, of its spiritual
order and discipline.&nbsp; The meeting was addressed by Mr.
Spooner, M.P., the Rev. J. Walsh, Wesleyan minister, and the Rev.
&mdash; Alexander, Baptist minister from Upton, who spoke in
favour of the original address, and C. Hanford, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>jun., Esq.,
for the amendment.&nbsp; The original address was carried by a
very large majority.&nbsp; Lord Lyttelton and Colonel Bund moved
an address to the Bishop of the Diocese; and on the motion of T.
G. Curtler, Esq., seconded by the Rev. J. Pearson, an addition
was made to this address, thanking the Bishop for having rebuked
and discouraged Tractarian principles and practices in this
diocese.&nbsp; Mr. Knight, M.P., and the Rev. G. Hodgson, moved
another formal resolution, and the thanks to the High Sheriff
were proposed by Lord Southwell and seconded by Sir O. P.
Wakeman.&nbsp; Meetings on this subject were held about the same
time at Stourport&mdash;T. S. Lea, Esq., presiding; at Malvern,
where T. C. Hornyold, Esq., and the Hon. Mr. Clifford, moved an
amendment; at Bromsgrove, Upton, Droitwich, Evesham, Bewdley,
Kidderminster (the Mayor presiding), Stourbridge, Dudley,
&amp;c.</p>
<h2><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>THE
COUNTY MAGISTRACY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> conduct of the general affairs
of the counties of England, such as their police, the regulation
of the gaols and lunatic asylums, the preservation of the county
bridges, the levying of rates, &amp;c., is intrusted to the
unpaid magistracy, nominated by the Lords Lieutenant, and
appointed by the Lord Chancellor; and at a time when an agitation
is afoot to change the character of the body by whom these
important matters are transacted, some consideration of the
manner in which they have discharged their high trust may be
opportune and useful.&nbsp; It is now proposed that a certain
number of persons, chosen by the Boards of Guardians of the
different Poor Law Unions, should be associated with a chosen
body of the magistracy to manage all the county business.&nbsp;
The principle sought to be carried out is one now generally
acknowledged as a just one&mdash;viz., that &ldquo;representation
should be coordinate with taxation;&rdquo; but it is worth
consideration whether anything will be gained by such a change of
system as is suggested, whether the interests of the ratepayers
are likely to be better cared for than they are at present, and
whether, indeed, they had not better let well alone.&nbsp; The
Bench of County Magistrates in Worcestershire may be supposed to
be a fair representation <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>of the magistracy of the kingdom
generally, and certainly on a review of their proceedings during
the last fifty years, especially with regard to financial
matters, the ratepayers must feel satisfied that their affairs
could not have been in better hands.&nbsp; The Worcestershire
Magistrates have had to consider, during the first half of the
nineteenth century, many matters involving a very large outlay of
the public money; and upon a review of the course they have
taken, no one will be able to point to an instance of grossly
unnecessary expenditure, or a lavishness in dealing with the
public purse.&nbsp; They have always given attention to the
representations of the ratepayers, but have not often suffered
themselves to be turned aside from what was a plainly desirable,
or necessary, object, by false considerations of economy, and
have generally taken an enlarged view of the question before
them.&nbsp; A most vigilant check has been kept upon the details
of the county expenditure, and a laudable desire to lessen the
general burden always been manifestly apparent.&nbsp; And they
have, of course, been free from those changes which
representative bodies from limited constituencies are ever and
anon pretty sure to undergo, when the fickleness of public
favour&mdash;some party cry, or prejudice, or the efforts of
individuals striving for place and power&mdash;suddenly
dispossess old and tried men from the offices for which they may
be eminently suited, in order to make way for unqualified
busybodies, whom the passing commotion may have brought into
notice&mdash;&ldquo;Straws,&rdquo; as Junius said of Wilks,
&ldquo;on the surface of the torrent.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while such
commotion lasts, brief as it may be, mischief is often done which
years are required to set straight again.</p>
<p>The Worcestershire Bench has, of late years, been singularly
fortunate in its chairmen.&nbsp; It is only another mark of their
anxiety to conduct their business on the <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>soundest
principles, that they have not suffered party considerations to
sway them in the choice of the person upon whose discretion and
judgment so much will always depend.&nbsp; The services of the
Right Hon. Baronet who now fills the chair at Quarter Sessions
have often been acknowledged, and are fully appreciated both by
his fellow magistrates, and the body of the county at large.</p>
<p>With regard to the administration of the criminal code which
now devolves to so great an extent upon courts of Quarter
Sessions, each year&rsquo;s experience adds its proof that the
substantial ends of justice are as well attained there&mdash;and
if the commonly received maxim, <i>Judex damnatur cum nocens
absolvitur</i>, be accepted as the test&mdash;even better
attained, than in any other criminal court in the kingdom.</p>
<p>In the very commencement of the present century, the county
magistracy were occupied with a matter as important&mdash;at
least, if the question of expense be taken as the criterion of
importance&mdash;as any that has been the subject of their
deliberations at more recent periods.&nbsp; It was the rebuilding
of the county prison.&nbsp; The county gaol formerly stood on
what is now known as Castle Hill, near to Edgar&rsquo;s Tower, in
the city of Worcester.&nbsp; It was extremely insecure; several
prisoners had escaped from it, and the complaints of its absolute
insufficiency for the purposes it was intended to answer, were
many and frequent. <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; The county magistrates had at
length come to a determination to build a new gaol on a different
site; but this was no sooner known than a violent opposition was
raised on the score of the cost, and few matters seem to have
created so much general alarm <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>and excitement throughout the
agricultural districts as this proposal.&nbsp; In April, 1802, a
meeting of landowners and others paying county rates was convened
at the Guildhall, Worcester, at which the High Sheriff, Mr.
Newnham, presided.&nbsp; There it was resolved, that the erection
of a new prison would be accompanied with great and unnecessary
expense, and that the existing gaol might be sufficiently
enlarged and repaired, at a moderate cost.&nbsp; The magistrates
still appearing determined to proceed, parish after parish
protested against any such step being taken, and these protests
signed by most of the influential tenant farmers, were published
time by time, occupying many columns of the then diminutive
Worcester newspapers.&nbsp; W. Welch, Esq., Chairman of Quarter
Sessions, in order to correct the misrepresentations which were
abroad on the subject, replied to these protests by a public
letter, in which he stated that the cost of a new gaol would only
be &pound;19,000, and that properly to repair the old one would
cost &pound;13,000; that the grand jury had so often presented
the gaol, that something was absolutely necessary to be done; and
that the burden on individual ratepayers would not be anything
like what was represented.&nbsp; Mr. R. Hudson of Wick, on the
other hand, challenged the magistrates to meet him at the Crown
Inn, Worcester, when he would prove to them that the proceedings
lately taken in the erection of a new prison had been irregular,
and could not be supported.</p>
<p>At the Midsummer Quarter Sessions in that year, Mr. Welch, in
his charge to the grand jury, recapitulated the causes which had
compelled the magistrates to determine on a new gaol, and in
proof of their desire to study the general interest of the
ratepayers, stated that, since he had occupied the chair, the
county accounts, which had formerly been in great confusion, had
been methodised and arranged, a saving had been effected <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>in the
expenditure of the gaol of some hundreds a year, and a
considerable annual allowance from the exchequer, hitherto
considered as a perquisite of the Under Sheriff&rsquo;s, proved
to be due to the county, and in future would be paid into the
general fund.</p>
<p>Yet so strong was the feeling against the new building that
the magistrates were compelled for awhile to abandon the project,
and it was not till the escape of more prisoners caused the Lord
Chief Baron Macdonald, at the Summer Assizes in 1807, to warn the
county grand jury that, if the gaol were not altered or rebuilt,
the county would be attached with a heavy fine for neglecting so
essential a part of its duty, that any further steps were taken
in the matter.&nbsp; At the Midsummer Sessions, 1808, the
magistrates determined, without delay, to build a new gaol, as
they believed that the old one admitted of no sufficient
alteration.&nbsp; The expense was estimated at &pound;18,000, and
the site in Salt Lane was fixed upon.&nbsp; The bench published a
minute statement of the number and amount of rates this
expenditure would render necessary.</p>
<p>A great deal of excitement and uneasiness, however, was found
still to prevail upon the subject, and it was especially said to
be unnecessary to change the site; so at the Epiphany Sessions,
1809, the matter was again taken into consideration, and the
bench adhered to their former determination, referring, however,
the question of site to a committee.&nbsp; Mr. Welch, the
chairman, about this time received an anonymous letter,
threatening his life, &ldquo;if he interfered any further
respecting a new prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At an adjourned sessions, held in February, 1809, the
magistrates finally determined on the land in Salt Lane as the
site for the new gaol, and adopted the plan of a Mr.
Sandys.&nbsp; They published the reasons for their decision at
length, the principal being, that the nature of the ground upon
which the old prison stood would <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>not admit of their obtaining a good
foundation for the extensive buildings contemplated.</p>
<p>The new prison was, after this, vigorously proceeded with, and
at the Epiphany Sessions, 1813, the chairman announced that the
new gaol was completed, and in spite of much difficulty about the
foundations, &amp;c., the cost was within the estimate.&nbsp; The
grand jury having inspected it, declared their entire approbation
of the works, and thanked the magistrates for their attention to
the interests of the county.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;A Special County Sessions was held in July this
year, to take into consideration the report of a committee
appointed to investigate charges of peculation brought against
Mr. Welch, the chairman, by Mr. Johnson, a fellow
magistrate.&nbsp; The matter arose out of Mr. Welch receiving
what were called &ldquo;justice wages,&rdquo; and paying thereout
for the dinners of the magistrates at the Hoppole.&nbsp; Mr.
Johnson declared that he had a balance in hand, on account of
this fund, of &pound;65, which, but for his discovery, Mr. Welch
would have appropriated.&nbsp; The committee, however, reported
that the charge was &ldquo;wholly unjustifiable and
unfounded,&rdquo; and a vote of thanks to Mr. Welch, &ldquo;for
his uniform, upright, and independent conduct,&rdquo; was
thereupon passed unanimously.&nbsp; Long replies and rejoinders,
from Mr. Johnson and Mr. Welch, afterwards appeared in the public
prints.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 28&mdash;In
consequence of Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s reiteration of the charge,
another Special Sessions was held this day, not very numerously
attended, at which a general resolution of confidence in Mr.
Welch was passed, but not unanimously; indeed a more strongly
worded motion had been negatived; and William Smith, Esq., gave
notice of a motion, at the next sessions, for the removal of Mr.
Welch from the chair.&nbsp; This, however, was abandoned.</p>
<p>1817&mdash;At the Easter Quarter Sessions, William Welch,
Esq., resigned the chair in consequence of ill health, after
having held it for nearly twenty years.&nbsp; Earl Beauchamp
moved a vote of thanks to Mr. Welch for the services which he had
rendered to the county, which was seconded by Lord Deerhurst, and
carried unanimously.&nbsp; The Right Hon. Earl Beauchamp was then
chosen chairman in his stead.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;The magistrates at the Michaelmas Sessions publish
a <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>declaration in the Worcester newspapers, of their
abhorrence of the blasphemous and seditious sentiments then
openly disseminated in society&mdash;of their attachment to the
throne&mdash;and of their full unanimous and unequivocal
determination to support the tried and invaluable
constitution.&nbsp; The grand jury do the same.&nbsp; [This was
just after the trial of Carlile for republishing Paine&rsquo;s
<i>Age of Reason</i>, and in the midst of the excitement
attendant on the Peterloo Massacre.]</p>
<p>At the same Sessions, Edmund Meysey Wigley, Esq., was chosen
chairman, in the room of Earl Beauchamp, who had expressed a wish
to relinquish the office.&nbsp; The noble Earl, however,
afterwards resumed its duties.</p>
<p>1823&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, Benjamin Johnson, Esq.,
was temporarily elected to the chair, now vacant by the decease
of Earl Beauchamp.</p>
<p>At the Michaelmas Sessions following, Henry Wakeman, Esq., of
Perdiswell, was unanimously chosen to the chair, on the motion of
Lord Deerhurst, seconded by Richard Spooner, Esq.</p>
<p>1824&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions, Mr. Wakeman declined the
proffered honour of the chair, as his health would not permit him
to discharge its duties, and proposed Lord Plymouth.&nbsp; This
was seconded by Sir Thomas Winnington, and his lordship was
thereupon elected.</p>
<p>1824&mdash;At the Easter Sessions, it was determined, after a
warm discussion and division, to erect a treadmill in the county
gaol.&nbsp; Thirteen magistrates said &ldquo;aye,&rdquo; and ten
&ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1826&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions, the Rev. Reginald Pyndar
introduced the subject of a &ldquo;Worcestershire Friendly
Society,&rdquo; and the formation of such a society being highly
approved of by the magistrates, a meeting was held the next day
in the Guildhall, with John Dent, Esq., Mayor, in the chair, and
the rules and tables proposed by Mr. Pyndar adopted as the basis
of an association for the benefit of the industrious and
provident poor of the county.</p>
<p>The society thus formed has continued to thrive and flourish
to the present day, and has been productive of many direct and
indirect benefits to a large number of the poorer class; helping
them to a knowledge of the advantages of
frugality&mdash;affording them a safe and profitable investment
for their surplus earnings&mdash;enabling them to escape from the
temptations of the public house, where the village club would
have required their attendance&mdash;and saving them from the
distress and misery that overtake the members of so many benefit
societies constructed upon false principles, or upon no
principles at all.&nbsp; <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>The society at present numbers 1,899
members, of whom one-third are females, and it has a very large
reserve fund.&nbsp; Great part of its successful working and
prosperity are attributable to the fostering care and interest of
the Rev. Thomas Pearson.&nbsp; The following is a statement of
the pecuniary affairs of the institution, from its formation to
the present time, which has been compiled by its efficient
secretary, Mr. Thomas Holloway.</p>

<p>1827&mdash;At the Easter Sessions, the Worcestershire and
Staffordshire Canal Company appealed against the sum at which
they were rated for their docks and basins at Stourport, by the
parish of Lower Mitton.&nbsp; It was stated in the course of the
proceedings, that the tonnage of the canal for the year ending
Michaelmas, 1826, was &pound;32,838.&nbsp; The officers of Lower
Mitton had taken the whole value of the basins as rateable there,
but the court decided that they must only charge for acreage,
computing the basins as they would other portions of the
canal.</p>
<p>1829&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 14&mdash;At the
Epiphany Quarter Sessions, the Earl of Plymouth resigned the
chairmanship; and on the motion of Major Bund, seconded by the
Earl of Beauchamp, Sir C. S. Smith, Bart., was elected in his
stead.</p>
<p>At these Sessions, the magistrates of Droitwich denied the
authority of the county magistrates to appoint visitors to the
Asylum for Pauper Lunatics kept by the Messrs. Ricketts in the
borough, and on the matter being referred to the law officers of
the crown, it was decided by them that the act passed in the
previous session of Parliament vested the appointment of visitors
in the magistracy of the borough <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>in which the asylum was
situate.&nbsp; Major Bund gave notice of a motion thereupon, to
consider the propriety of building a County Lunatic Asylum.</p>
<p>1829&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions, the magistrates altered
the divisions of the county for Petty Sessional purposes, forming
them into eight districts, to be called &ldquo;The Upton,
Pershore, Hundred House, Worcester, Kidderminster, Droitwich,
Northfield, and Blockley Divisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1829&mdash;An adjourned Sessions was held in November, to
consider the propriety of erecting County Courts, the
inconvenience of the City Hall having been commented on at every
Sessions and Assizes which had taken place for some years
past.&nbsp; A case had been laid before Mr. Sergeant Russell, to
have his opinion as to whether the magistrates could legally
spend money on the enlargement and improvement of courts
belonging to the city, and he had replied that they could not;
and that if they wanted a Shire Hall of their own, they must
obtain a special Act of Parliament for it.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr.
Pearson, after reporting the failure of all attempts at
negociation with the Worcester Corporation, moved &ldquo;that it
was necessary to erect new courts and suitable lodgings for the
judges, and that the magistrates should take the necessary steps
for obtaining an Act of Parliament for that purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This resolution was seconded by Colonel Bromley.&nbsp; Earl
Somers moved an adjournment of the question, on the ground that
in the then depressed state of the country the expense ought not
to be incurred.&nbsp; This was seconded by Osman Ricardo,
Esq.&nbsp; An adjournment &ldquo;to the next Epiphany
Sessions&rdquo; was carried; but Lord Foley then moved,
&ldquo;That it is the opinion of this court that the present
courts and judges&rsquo; lodgings are totally
insufficient.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was seconded by R. Spooner, Esq.;
and Colonel Davies opposed it, because he thought that the
agitation of the subject was ill-timed.&nbsp; Lord Foley&rsquo;s
motion was ultimately carried by 20 to 17.&nbsp; A committee was
then appointed to have another conference with the City
Corporation.</p>
<p>Nine Catholic noblemen and gentlemen were now for the first
time inserted in the Commission of the Peace for this
county&mdash;viz., the Earl of Shrewsbury, Viscount Southwell,
Sir E. Blount, Sir C. Throckmorton, R. Berkeley, Esq., W.
Wakeman, Esq., T. C. Hornyold, Esq., C. E. Hanford, Esq., and W.
Acton, Esq.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions, the question of new
courts was again discussed.&nbsp; The committee reported that
they found the Guildhall, Worcester, erected in 1721, belonged
exclusively to the <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>city.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Pearson again moved that an Act
of Parliament should be applied for, with a view to the erection
of a Shire Hall; and this was seconded by the Rev. George
Turberville.&nbsp; Major General Marriott moved as an amendment,
that the Deputy Clerk of the Peace should be instructed to lay a
presentment of the present courts before the grand jury at the
next assizes.&nbsp; James Taylor, Esq., seconded this.&nbsp; Lord
Deerhurst then moved a resolution, declaring that the county, in
the present depressed condition of all classes, would rather
submit to the inconvenience of the present courts than incur the
expense of new ones, which was seconded by Dr. B. Cooper.&nbsp;
Lord Deerhurst&rsquo;s amendment was negatived by 31 to 25, and
General Marriott&rsquo;s without a division.&nbsp; Earl Somers
then moved the appointment of a committee to ascertain the
practicability of so altering the present courts as to make them
sufficiently convenient.&nbsp; This was seconded by John
Williams, Esq., but rejected by 31 to 24, and Mr. Pearson&rsquo;s
original motion was then carried.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 29&mdash;The
general state of the county caused Viscount Deerhurst to summon
the magistrates to a meeting, at which the following resolution
was passed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the general peaceable state of the county of
Worcester affords a subject of great congratulation.&nbsp; The
magistrates, however, viewing with the utmost abhorrence the
atrocious acts of violence which have taken place in other
counties, feel it their duty to declare that they have made such
arrangements as, by giving full effect to the existing laws, are
best calculated to prevent the occurrence of similar calamities
in this county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1831&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions, the subject of new courts
was resumed.&nbsp; Several plans for the enlargement of the
Guildhall were laid before the magistrates, but the court adopted
a resolution proposed by the Earl of Plymouth, without a
division.&nbsp; It ran thus: &ldquo;That the consideration of the
question, relative to the alteration of the courts of justice, be
adjourned <i>sine die</i>, it being found inexpedient to enlarge
the Guildhall; but that a bill authorising the magistrates to
build new courts, at a future period, be drawn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1831&mdash;At the Easter Sessions, J. H. H. Foley, Esq., M.P.,
and Lord Lyttelton, urged the necessity of building a gaol at
Stourbridge, but the proposition was negatived by 27 to 14.&nbsp;
Petitions against the bill for legalising the sale of beer to be
drunk on the premises in beer houses, were agreed to at the
instance of Dr. Beale Cooper.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, it was resolved that the
new courts should be erected at the back of the gaol, and that
the <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>expense should not exceed &pound;25,000.&nbsp; The bill
had been brought in by the county members, and read a first time
the Friday before.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions, Dr. Beale Cooper proposed
the enlargement of the gaol, which was referred to a
committee.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Pearson proposed that plans
should be immediately selected for new county courts adjoining
the gaol.&nbsp; The Rev. George Turberville proposed that the
matter should be further delayed till the next September, and Mr.
Pearson&rsquo;s motion was carried by 24 to 8.</p>
<p>A vote of thanks was passed to Earl Plymouth and the Yeomanry,
for their promptitude and firmness in quelling riots in the
county.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, the order which had been
made at a previous sessions to build the new county courts on
land adjoining the gaol, was rescinded, on the motion of the Rev.
George Turberville, seconded by Mr. Pakington, by a large
majority, and the committee were directed to look out for another
site.</p>
<p>At these Sessions was discussed a matter which excited great
interest amongst the legal profession, viz., the allowance of
fees to attorneys, who for some two or three sessions had only
been paid &pound;1. 1s. for brief and attendance, instead of
&pound;2. 14s. 4d., as formerly.&nbsp; The solicitors were heard
by counsel, and the former payment was restored.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions, a new valuation of the
county parishes was read by General Marriott.&nbsp; The land
assessable was valued at &pound;741,854&mdash;the old valuation
had been &pound;750,250; so that the land had decreased in value
about 3d. in the pound, or 1&frac14; per cent.</p>
<p>The question of erecting county courts again came under
consideration&mdash;the present site in Foregate Street, and one
in Pierpoint Street, both being proposed, and the former was
adopted by a majority of 30 to 14.&nbsp; Premiums were offered
for the three best plans.</p>
<p>1833&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions, the court proceeded to
the appointment of a chaplain to the county gaol, the office
being now vacant by the resignation of the Rev. J. Hadley.&nbsp;
A resolution was first proposed by Major Bund, and carried by a
large majority, &ldquo;That a beneficed clergyman ought not to be
appointed chaplain to the gaol.&rdquo;&nbsp; Votes were given for
eight candidates, but the contest lay between the Rev. J.
Adlington, who received 22 votes, and the Rev. W. Dunn, who had
14.</p>
<p>1833&mdash;At the Easter Sessions, it was resolved, upon the
motion <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>of
the Rev. Thomas Pearson, that &ldquo;henceforth this court should
be an open one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The county was called upon to pay &pound;759. 17s. for special
constables employed by the Sheriff to keep the peace at the last
election.</p>
<p>Three plans were laid before the court, by the committee, for
the new county courts, viz., one by Mr. Charles Day, Worcester;
Mr. Mead, London; and Mr. Habershon, London.&nbsp; Previous to
deciding upon them, General Mariott moved that the erection of
the courts should be postponed till the enlargement of the gaol
should be completed, in order that two such serious expenses
might not be pressing on the county at the same time.&nbsp; A
number of letters from different parishes had been received by
the chairman, remonstrating against new courts, but General
Mariott&rsquo;s motion was lost by 30 to 10.&nbsp; The three
plans were then submitted to the court for choice, and the Rev.
Mr. Pearson regretted that one from a Mr. Haycock, which he
thought undoubtedly the best, was not amongst them.&nbsp; Mr.
Mead&rsquo;s was recommended by the committee as the best, but
fifteen magistrates voted for Mr. Day&rsquo;s, and only three for
each of the others.&nbsp; Many magistrates refused to vote; and
the general feeling of the public at the time was, that the
advantage of the county, and the embellishment of the city, had
been sacrificed to personal interest created by a canvass.&nbsp;
A committee was appointed, with the Rev. Thomas Pearson as its
chairman, to carry the plan thus chosen into execution.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;At the Epiphany County Sessions, the salary of the
county treasurer (Sir A. Lechmere) was reduced from &pound;100 to
&pound;60&mdash;because it was higher than that paid by adjoining
counties, and farmers were in distress&mdash;by a majority of 39
to 20.&nbsp; Various reductions were also made in the fees of the
clerk of the peace.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;At the Easter Quarter Sessions, Sir C. S. Smith,
Bart., resigned the chairmanship&mdash;the calamity which he had
recently sustained, in the loss of his lady, inducing him to
retire altogether from public life.&nbsp; The Rev. George
Turberville immediately moved the following resolution:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the court is fully sensible of, and grateful for,
the valuable services of their late chairman, Sir C. S. Smith,
Bart., and deeply regrets that he feels himself unable to
continue those services for the benefit of the county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was seconded by John Williams, Esq., and carried
unanimously.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions there was a very full
attendance of magistrates, and the Rev. George Turberville was
requested to <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>preside as senior.&nbsp; The first business was to
elect a chairman, in the room of Sir C. S. Smith, Bart.,
resigned; and on the motion of the Rev. president, seconded by
James Taylor, Esq., John Somerset Pakington, Esq., was
unanimously elected to the office which he has ever since filled
with so much ability and advantage to the county.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions the magistrates agreed to
a petition to Parliament against the Bill for permitting counsel
for a prisoner in all cases to address the jury&mdash;a privilege
hitherto confined to cases of misdemeanour.&nbsp; Mr. Temple,
General Marriott, and Mr. Hanford were the only
dissentients.&nbsp; The measure, it was said, would tend to
defeat the ends of justice by the frequent acquittal of guilty
persons, and to bring juries into discredit by inclining them to
found their verdicts rather on the arguments of counsel than upon
the facts.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 9&mdash;A Special
Sessions held, Dr. Beale Cooper in the chair, to consider what
was to be done about the New County Courts and Judges&rsquo;
Lodgings, as the magistrates had expended the &pound;25,000 they
were empowered to raise by the first act.&nbsp; After a long
discussion, it was unanimously determined to apply for a fresh
act immediately, enabling them to raise &pound;7,000 more.&nbsp;
[Parliament refused to depart from its standing orders, and so
the bill could not be introduced that session.]</p>
<p>1836&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions the Prisoners&rsquo;
Counsel Act was first brought into operation; and it is strange
how unanimously an arrangement&mdash;now admitted on all hands to
be a good one&mdash;was condemned and found fault with.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;The Midsummer Sessions were held in the New Courts,
though these were as yet scarcely completed.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 10&mdash;A Special
County Sessions, to consider the Bill then before Parliament for
Amending the Constitution of County Courts and Courts of Quarter
Sessions&mdash;which proposed to compel the holding of eight
sessions in the year, and the holding of courts in various parts
of the county; it gave the magistrates the option of having a
barrister as a salaried chairman; and proposed alterations in
&ldquo;county courts,&rdquo; to enable them to be used for the
easy recovery of small debts.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington moved a
petition against the measure, which Mr. Holland objected
to&mdash;it was, however, carried by a majority of 23 to 8.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions the New Shire Hall and
Judges&rsquo; Lodgings were reported as complete; and a vote of
thanks was passed to the Rev. Thomas Pearson for his able and
useful exertions as chairman of the building committee for the
past five <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>years.&nbsp; The salary of the chaplain was increased
to &pound;250 per annum.&nbsp; The court refused to insert the
county advertisements either in the <i>Kidderminster
Messenger</i> or the <i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;The Epiphany Sessions adjourned to the 14th of
January, and afterwards given up entirely, because no clerk of
the peace had been appointed since the death of Mr.
Blayney&mdash;Lord Foley, the Lord Lieutenant, being out of the
country.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 5&mdash;A
General Sessions of the Peace held in lieu of the Epiphany
Sessions, which had been given up.&nbsp; The court petition for a
change of law as regards beer houses.&nbsp; The enlargement of
the County Gaol, at an expense of &pound;2,100, agreed upon, to
obtain sixty additional cells.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;At the Easter Sessions the court unanimously agreed
to a resolution which the chairman proposed, condemning the
existing system of parish constables as insufficient for the
detection and punishment of criminals, and promising
consideration to any measure the Government might introduce for
establishing a rural constabulary.&nbsp; The court again
petitioned against the District Courts&rsquo; Bill; Mr. Hanford
alone dissenting.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions the important subject of
establishing a rural police was brought forward by Mr. Pakington,
according to previous notice.&nbsp; He entered into the whole
subject with great ability; pointing out the great increase of
crime in the rural districts, as rendering such a measure
absolutely necessary, and ended by moving that &ldquo;it was
expedient forthwith to take measures for the adoption in this
county of the act for the establishment of county district
constables.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a short discussion the motion was
carried with only two dissentients&mdash;Dr. Cooper and Rev. Mr.
Cartwright.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington proposed that a chief constable
and twelve sergeants should be the only appointments under the
act at present, because it would be desirable to bring it into
operation by degrees.&nbsp; To this Mr. Hanford moved as an
amendment, that there should be a chief constable, ten sergeants,
and thirty men under them; and this was carried over the original
motion by 20 to 18.&nbsp; The salary of the chief constable was
fixed at &pound;250 a year; and the Metropolitan Commissioners of
Police were requested to nominate a suitable person.&nbsp; The
court then adjourned till the 4th November, to receive and
consider the rules drawn up by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 4&mdash;At the
Adjourned Sessions, Mr. Pakington stated that the Government
refused to allow the Commissioners of Police to nominate a chief
constable, and expressed his great regret <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>that this
should be the case, as he thought the magistrates quite
incompetent to select a suitable person.&nbsp; He proposed,
therefore, that the court should adjourn to the 2nd December,
then to consider all applications which might be made for the
office, and proceed to the election.&nbsp; Dr. Beale Cooper moved
that the further consideration of the plan for forming a
constabulary force for the county of Worcester be postponed till
the next Easter Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; He maintained that the
thing was altogether in a crude state&mdash;had not had
sufficient examination&mdash;that it was a departure from the
spirit of the British constitution&mdash;and that their present
constables were sufficiently on the alert, for since the year
1806 the commitments had increased from 51 to 427&mdash;the
number in the previous year.&nbsp; William Acton, Esq., seconded
the amendment, because he thought the act would probably be
altered next session, and because he objected to the expense
coming wholly out of the county rates.&nbsp; General Marriott,
James Taylor, Esq., and Richard Spooner, Esq., spoke in favour of
the motion; and the Rev. Mr. Cartwright for the amendment.&nbsp;
Lord Lyttelton thought they were forced to adopt a rural police,
because Birmingham and Gloucestershire had got a new force, and
the chairman said that they should lose public confidence if a
comparatively small bench of magistrates reversed that which had
been done a month before by a much larger one.&nbsp; On a
division, Mr. Pakington&rsquo;s motion was carried by 24 to
9.&nbsp; A letter was agreed to, to be sent to the Secretary of
State, complaining of the determination Government had come to in
the matter of the chief constable.&nbsp; The rules sent down by
the Secretary of State for the guidance of the force were agreed
to.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 2&mdash;Mr. R.
R. Harris, an inspector of London Police, elected chief
constable.&nbsp; He had been recommended by the police committee
out of 32 applicants, and was chosen by a majority of 21 to 13
votes given for Captain Scargill, who was proposed by the Earl of
Coventry.&nbsp; It was determined that the pay of the sergeants
should be &pound;80 a year.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 29&mdash;At the
Michaelmas Sessions the magistrates became embroiled in a dispute
with Mr. W. S. P. Hughes, one of the county coroners, arising out
of a complaint made by the constable of Rock, who accused Mr.
Hughes of &ldquo;extorting&rdquo; a fee of a shilling from him
illegally.&nbsp; The fee was &ldquo;for the crier of the
court,&rdquo; which the coroners in this county had always been
in the habit of requiring, but after the passing of the act, 1
and 2 Victoria, certainly could not be sustained; and this Mr.
Hughes admitted in a letter to the <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>committee of magistrates which had
been appointed to take the matter into consideration.&nbsp; This,
however, the committee said came too late; as Mr. Hughes had been
repeatedly warned that the fee was illegal, and they considered
that he had rendered himself liable to a prosecution &ldquo;for
extortion and misconduct in his office,&rdquo; or might be
removed from the coronership altogether by a petition to the Lord
Chancellor.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes applied to be heard against the
report, by counsel, but this the court refused by a majority of
33 to 7.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes then protested against the proceedings
of the committee as <i>ex parte</i>, and their report as showing
an animus against him wholly unwarranted and improper.&nbsp; Mr.
Charles Best, coroner, deposed that he and his predecessors in
office had always been in the habit of requiring this
shilling.&nbsp; After a discussion, the Rev. Thomas Pearson moved
the adoption of the report, and that the chairman should inform
Mr. Hughes that his charge was illegal, and admonish him
accordingly.&nbsp; This was carried, and the chairman
&ldquo;admonished&rdquo; Mr. Hughes, who immediately
said&mdash;&ldquo;I do not consider you have any power to
admonish me.&nbsp; I, as coroner of this county, am an officer
far superior to the magistrates of this court; and I take leave
to tell them that they by no means adopt a proper course when
they take upon themselves to admonish a superior officer of the
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 4&mdash;Mr. Helm
unanimously appointed county solicitor.&nbsp; The Quarter
Sessions advertisements ordered to be inserted in the
<i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>, but not in the <i>Kidderminster
Messenger</i>.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 5&mdash;At the
Easter Sessions, a new assessment of the county by surveyors was
ordered, on which to base the county rate, and &pound;500 placed
at the disposal of a committee to obtain it.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 3&mdash;At the
Epiphany Sessions, the court agreed to memorialise the Government
to pay the cost of the rural police.&nbsp; Memorials from five
parishes were presented, complaining of the expense of the
police, and declaring that the county rates were nearly doubled
by them.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 27&mdash;At the
Midsummer Sessions, Dr. Beale Cooper brought forward a motion for
the abolition of the rural police, which he said was
unconstitutional, and had proved to be utterly inefficient.&nbsp;
Colonel Bund seconded the motion.&nbsp; The chairman disposed of
Dr. Cooper&rsquo;s charge of inefficiency in a few words, and
regretted that the establishment of a police was not made
compulsory on all counties.&nbsp; Dr. Cooper then withdrew his
motion.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions, Dr. Cooper moved that
the <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>county police force be reduced to one sergeant for each
Electoral Division, and two constables for each Petty Sessional
Division; to which the chairman moved as an amendment, that the
question of the propriety of a reduction be referred to the
police committee, and this was carried without a division.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 2&mdash;At the
Epiphany Sessions, the subject of the rural police was again
discussed at great length on the presentation of a special report
by the police committee, declaring that the force ought not to be
reduced.&nbsp; Mr. Onslow wanted to prevent the reception of the
report, but the chairman would not consent to that course, and
Mr. Onslow at last was induced to withdraw the resolutions he had
intended to propose upon the subject; but a committee was formed
to inquire into the provisions of the Parochial Constables&rsquo;
Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellins&rsquo;s case was brought before the court at these
Sessions by Richard Spooner, Esq., who moved for a committee of
inquiry into the facts under which Mr. Ricketts had been libelled
in the <i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>, as it was alleged that
Mr. Ellins had supplied the information on which the libel was
founded.&nbsp; Colonel Bund seconded the motion.&nbsp; Mr.
Hanford opposed it, because they would be stepping out of their
jurisdiction; and the chairman could not tell what was to be the
course or purpose of such a committee.&nbsp; The committee was
determined on by 34 to 10, and the chairman, Mr. Hanford, Mr.
Spooner, Rev. T. Pearson, Mr. Skey, Hon. W. C. Talbot, and Mr.
Temple, were placed upon it.&nbsp; Mr. Ellins&rsquo;s application
to be heard before it by attorney, was agreed to.</p>
<p>The chairman at these Sessions addressed a most valuable
statement to the grand jury on the county expenditure, and the
causes of the increase in the number and cost of criminal
prosecutions.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;At the Easter Sessions the committee appointed in
Mr. Ellins&rsquo;s case were about to bring forward their report,
when Mr. R. Scott and Mr. R. M. Mence moved that it should not be
read, as the matter was one altogether out of the jurisdiction of
the court, and with which they had no right to deal.&nbsp; On a
division, 20 hands were held up for its being read, to 9 against
it.&nbsp; The report was then read, and stated the committee to
be of opinion that &ldquo;Mr. Ellins was the moving party to the
publication in the <i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>, of a most
gross and unfounded libel, imputing corruption and jobbing to W.
H. Ricketts, Esq., in the execution of his duty as a magistrate
and member of the police committee, in carrying into effect the
orders <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>of the court.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hanford and the Rev.
Thomas Pearson, as members of the committee, declared that though
they believed Mr. Ellins to be a party to the libel, they did not
believe him to be the sole party, as the report seemed to
convey.&nbsp; Mr. Scott moved that the report be rejected.&nbsp;
The court had no right to take any judicial notice of the acts or
character of any of its individual members; and nothing could be
more dangerous than for a judicial body to exceed its
jurisdiction.&nbsp; Mr. Scott condemned Mr. Spooner for bringing
this matter forward at the previous Sessions without
notice.&nbsp; Mr. Benson also spoke against the reception of the
report.&nbsp; The chairman had always had doubts as to the
propriety of their moving in the matter, but thought it
discourteous to the committee to reject the report, and it was
received by a majority of 28 to 11.&nbsp; On the question of
transmitting it to the Lord Lieutenant, there was another
division, 20 voting for that course and 11 against it.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, Lord Lyttelton addressed
a letter to the court, enclosing one from the Lord Chancellor,
with his opinion that the proceedings of the magistrates in Mr.
Ellins&rsquo;s case had been very irregular.&nbsp; Lord Lyttelton
trusted the magistrates would feel it their &ldquo;duty carefully
to avoid any similar proceedings for the future;&rdquo; and he
requested that his letter might be entered upon the records of
the court.&nbsp; Mr. Spooner thought they had a perfect right to
do as they had done, and moved that the letter be not entered on
the records.&nbsp; The chairman said he had always considered
their proceedings irregular, but thought Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;lecture&rdquo; might just as well have been left
alone.&nbsp; The consideration of the letter was at last
postponed till the next Sessions.</p>
<p>Mr. Simcox Lea at great length entered into the subject of the
rural police, and moved, as a resolution, that their benefit had
not been equivalent to their cost.&nbsp; He wanted the Bench to
adopt the plan of paid parish constables in their stead, and
insisted particularly on the inefficiency of the chief
constable.&nbsp; Mr. Noel seconded the motion.&nbsp; The chairman
made an able defence of the police, and adduced several instances
of their efficiency.&nbsp; Mr. Scott would vote for the motion,
because the police were too few to be of much use.&nbsp; Mr.
Onslow complained of the number of offences that were committed
without detection ensuing.&nbsp; Colonel Bund, the Rev. Thomas
Pearson, Mr. Benson, and Colonel Clive, spoke in favour of the
police, and the motion was rejected by 34 to 13.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions the magistrates
determined that the Lord Lieutenant&rsquo;s letter, in Mr.
Ellins&rsquo;s case, should not be placed <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>upon the
records of the court.&nbsp; Mr. Scott was the only magistrate who
added anything to the few words which were spoken from the
chairman; and he said the whole proceedings ought to be erased
from the records, or the Lord Lieutenant&rsquo;s letter to be
added as the conclusion.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;At the Easter Sessions, Lord Lyttelton read a paper
<i>in re</i> Mr. Ellins&rsquo;s case, declaring the
magistrates&rsquo; proceedings in the matter to have been
altogether irregular, and suggesting that they ought to be
entirely struck out of the records of the court, or his own
letter of animadversion on them inserted.&nbsp; As his lordship
concluded with no motion, the chairman would not permit any
discussion, and the court passed to the next business on the
paper.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, Mr. Scott again brought
this matter forward, by moving that the letter of the Lord
Chancellor to the Lord Lieutenant should be entered on the
minutes of the court.&nbsp; This was seconded by the Rev. John
Pearson, but opposed by the chairman and others, and at last
rejected by 28 to 17.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;At the Easter Quarter Sessions, the police
committee recommended that Dudley, Shipston, and other districts,
surrounded by other counties, should be taken into this county
for police purposes, and that, to this end, the force should be
increased by twenty men, including a superintendent and two
sergeants.&nbsp; Mr. Merry moved that only twelve men be added to
the force, but this was negatived by 26 to 6, and the original
motion carried.&nbsp; Mr. Hanford&rsquo;s motion to do away with
the carts and horses kept by the rural police was negatived by 20
to 17.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, Mr. B. L. Stable was
elected Governor of the County Gaol, in the room of Mr. Lavender,
who retired, and was voted a pension of &pound;149. 10s. per
annum.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;At the Epiphany Sessions the court agreed to erect
a Lunatic Asylum, in connection with the city of Worcester, for
the accommodation of 200 pauper lunatics.&nbsp; The total number
of such unfortunate beings in Worcestershire was 284, but the
court conceived that accommodation for two-thirds would be quite
sufficient; and on Dr. B. Cooper suggesting that three-fourths
should be provided for, the chairman begged the court not to
agree to providing for more than 200 in the first instance, as
the expense of these erections was so great.&nbsp; A committee
was formed for the purpose of carrying the measure into
effect.&nbsp; The Hon. and Rev. W. W. C. Talbot moved for a
committee to consider the propriety of dividing the county into
districts for police purposes; but Mr. Curtler, from a very
carefully <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>prepared table, showed that the police force and their
expense were very equitably distributed with regard to the value
of the property to be protected in the different districts of the
county, and that the agricultural portion were in no sense paying
for the support of the police of the manufacturing
districts.&nbsp; Mr. Talbot withdrew his motion.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;At the Easter Sessions the court, on the motion of
the Rev. Thomas Pearson and Mr. Curtler, unanimously agreed to
petition in favour of the Juvenile Offenders&rsquo; Bill, then
introduced into Parliament by Sir John Pakington.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;Easter Sessions&mdash;On the 19th of December,
1846, the county was divided into three Coroners&rsquo; districts
by an Order in Council; and at these Sessions the magistrates
assigned these districts to Mr. Docker, Mr. Hughes, and Mr.
Best.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson still continues to act as coroner for
Dudley, but, at his death, Dudley will form district No. 6 in
Staffordshire.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes, shortly after his district was
assigned, petitioned the Lords of the Treasury for compensation
for loss of emolument which he said he sustained by this
arrangement, and they awarded him &pound;55 per annum.&nbsp; He
was paid two quarters by the county authorities, but they then
took an opinion as to the legality of his claim, and this being
adverse to Mr. Hughes, they refused to continue the
payments.&nbsp; In Hilary Term, 1850, Mr. Hughes applied to the
Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench, and obtained a rule <i>nisi</i>
against the magistrates, to compel them to show cause why the
payment should not be continued&mdash;which, however, was
afterwards discharged, on the ground that as the county had never
been customarily divided into districts, Mr. Hughes could not
show a loss of any fees to which he was legally entitled.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;At the Midsummer Quarter Sessions the court agreed
to erect Stourport and neighbourhood into a separate Petty
Sessional Division.&nbsp; The Hundred House and Kidderminster
magistrates opposed the motion, but it was carried by 18 to
15.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions the committee of
visitors appointed to superintend the erection of the Lunatic
Asylum reported that they had not been able to obtain any tenders
for executing the works required at the sum estimated by the
architect, chiefly because the lunacy commissioners insisted on
the whole building being made fireproof.&nbsp; The total cost of
land and buildings would be about &pound;32,000, other extras
&pound;3,044; and fittings were not included even in this
sum.&nbsp; They had agreed with the London Life Insurance Society
for a loan of the money at four per cent.&nbsp; The report was
unanimously received.</p>
<p>1850&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions a report was read from a
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>committee which had been appointed to inquire into the
county expenditure, and to ascertain the feasibility of
reduction.&nbsp; The cost of prosecutions and gaol expenses for
the year 1849 was &pound;8,993.&nbsp; 18s. 3d.; salaries,
&pound;2,661. 5s. 2d.; high constable&rsquo;s cravings,
&pound;240; coroner&rsquo;s cravings, &pound;1,527. 0s. 10d.;
clerk of the peace&rsquo;s cravings, &pound;745. 18s. 2d.;
registration of voters, &pound;342. 11s. 8d.; bridges,
&pound;580.&nbsp; 14s. 5d.; lunatics, &pound;193. 4s. 2d.; new
weights and measures, &pound;858. 3s. 10d.; sundries,
&pound;1,099; total, &pound;17,240. 13s. 2d.; police,
&pound;7,836.&nbsp; 6s. 9d.; Shire Hall, &pound;1,696. 12s.
9d.&nbsp; The committee reported that the only way in which a
reduction could possibly be effected was a reduction in the
salaries of the general officers and of the police, which they
did not deem advisable, and would rather recommend that
Government should be memorialised to defray the cost of the
county police, gaol, &amp;c., out of the consolidated fund.&nbsp;
The report was adopted without any division.</p>
<p>At the dinner of the magistrates, at the Shire Hall, after the
transaction of the county business, the Rev. Thomas Pearson being
in the chair, a portrait of Sir John Pakington, Bart., the result
of a subscription amongst the magistrates, and which now hangs in
the drawing room at the County Courts, was inaugurated.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Upton Bridge</span> has been the
<i>b&ecirc;te noir</i> of the county magistrates all through the
half century.&nbsp; Since 1810 scarcely a sessions has passed at
which it has not been mentioned, and it has given rise to
lawsuits, disputes, and embroilments without number.&nbsp; In
1814&ndash;16, in 1829, and again in 1847, the magistrates took
proceedings against the feoffees of Hall&rsquo;s
Charity&mdash;some lands left in 1570 for the repairs of Upton
Church and Bridge&mdash;to compel them to account or to
contribute towards the repairs of this bridge.&nbsp; In 1817 the
bridge was reported to be in very doubtful plight, and the advice
of Mr. Smirke, the eminent architect, was taken as to the repairs
which ought to be done; a considerable sum of money was then laid
out upon it.&nbsp; At the Michaelmas Sessions, 1822, a bridge
warden was appointed, because much injury had been done to it by
mooring vessels to the parapets, and by taking away sand from the
foundations.&nbsp; In 1832&ndash;34 another considerable sum was
spent in repairs; this time the feoffees of Hall&rsquo;s Charity
being concurring parties.&nbsp; In 1837 the parties promoting the
Severn Navigation Improvement offered the magistrates
&pound;5,000 towards the expense of building a new bridge, but
this was not acceeded to; and in 1838 the bench resolved to
procure the insertion of a clause in the Severn Navigation Bill
then <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>before Parliament, to bear the county harmless from any
loss or damage which might arise to Upton bridge from the
improvements in the river; but no proceedings were necessary to
be taken under that resolution, because the bill was thrown
out.&nbsp; In 1842, &pound;121 were expended in repairs, to keep
the bridge from falling.&nbsp; The magistrates would not do more
than was absolutely necessary, because they did not know how the
operations of the Severn Commissioners might affect it.&nbsp; At
the Midsummer Sessions, 1845, a committee was appointed to confer
with the commissioners about the state of the bridge.&nbsp; At
the Epiphany Sessions, 1846, the county surveyors recommended
that &pound;1,260 should be immediately spent on the bridge; and
the magistrates at the same Sessions declared themselves
&ldquo;neutral&rdquo; as to the bill then introduced by the
Severn Commissioners.&nbsp; This bill took power to alter the
bridge by the introduction of a swivel.&nbsp; At the Epiphany
Sessions, 1847, Mr. Curtler read an elaborate report, in
explanation of the liability of the feoffees of Hall&rsquo;s
Charity to aid in the repairs of the bridge; in consequence of
which proceedings were taken, and in 1849 the matter was referred
to a Master in Chancery.&nbsp; It was not finally settled till
1851, when Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls, ordered the
feoffees thenceforth to divide the receipts into three
parts&mdash;the first for the church, the second for the repairs
of the bridge, and the third for the general good of the
town.&nbsp; At the Michaelmas Sessions, 1847, another committee
was appointed to inquire into the state of the bridge, and to
confer with the Severn Navigation Commissioners; but at the next
Epiphany Sessions, Mr. Curtler, by a majority of 19 to 8, carried
a proposition to seek to obtain a clause in the
Commissioners&rsquo; Bill then before Parliament, to limit their
power over the bridge to three years: the bill, however, was
thrown out on second reading.&nbsp; The rest of the year was
consumed in an attempt to get from Mr. Walker, C.E., a report on
the state of the bridge, and in conferences with the
Commissioners.&nbsp; At the Easter Sessions, 1849, Mr.
Walker&rsquo;s report was read, which recommended that the bridge
should entirely be rebuilt; and a motion to that effect, made by
the chairman, was carried almost unanimously.&nbsp; It is
needless now to say, that nothing further was done in the matter
but to talk about it at each succeeding Sessions, till the bridge
concluded its own history by falling down during a high flood
which occurred in February, 1851.&nbsp; It was built in 1605; and
there can be no doubt that four of the original arches remained
just as they had been first erected, until the day when they
tumbled down of sheer old age.</p>

110</span>REMARKABLE TRIALS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following are brief notes of
some of the more interesting trials, as well civil as criminal,
which have occupied the attention of the Courts of Assize, or
Quarter Sessions, in this county, during the present century.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">King</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Waddington</span>&mdash;In the summer of 1800 a
criminal information was filed against S. F. Waddington, Esq., an
eminent hop merchant residing in London, &ldquo;for monopolising
practices in the purchase of hops&rdquo; in this county.&nbsp;
The rule having been made absolute, the case came on for trial at
the Worcestershire Summer Assizes, in that year, before Sir Simon
Le Blanc and a special jury, at Nisi Prius.&nbsp; Mr. Plumer,
principal counsel for prosecution, stated the offence to
be&mdash;enhancing the price of hops by spreading rumours of
scarcity among the planters, advising them not to sell, and by
engrossing a large quantity of that commodity.&nbsp; Mr.
Waddington was described as having invited the planters to a
dinner, and given them as a toast, &ldquo;Hops, &pound;20 a
cwt;&rdquo; telling them that they had never had a large enough
price, begging them to hold back, and promising to buy himself at
an increased rate, rather than they should be distressed for
money.&nbsp; Such was the enthusiasm created by his speech, that
one gentleman got up afterwards and proposed, &ldquo;Mr.
Waddington, the saviour of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
afterwards did buy great quantities of hops in Worcester market,
at prices varying from 10s. to 40s. above those current prior to
his appearance.&nbsp; The counsel characterised this forestalling
as a &ldquo;crime of deepest dye;&rdquo; and &ldquo;long, very
long, had the people of this country borne with the most
exemplary fortitude this greatest of all public
evils.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Dauncey, Mr. Waddington&rsquo;s
counsel, insisted that his client had only acted as other factors
were in the habit of doing, and if he were punished, the private
enterprise of the country would receive a most grievous check and
injury.&nbsp; He said the offence of &ldquo;engrossing&rdquo; was
a most undefinable one, and not cognizable by the common
law.&nbsp; The learned judge admitted this was a moot point, but
remarked on the enormity of the offence, and told the jury they
had only to say whether or no the evidence made out to them the
fact of Mr. Waddington&rsquo;s having done that which the
indictment set forth.&nbsp; The jury, after this charge,
immediately returned a verdict of &ldquo;guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the 24th of November, Mr. Waddington was brought up for judgment
in King&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp; Mr. Law moved in arrest of judgment,
arguing that engrossing was no longer an offence at common
law.&nbsp; Hops, too, were not &ldquo;victuals.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Waddington, speaking in his own defence, arraigned the whole
proceedings as altogether incompatible with the right of the
individual to use his capital in trade as he pleased.&nbsp; Mr.
Erskine, in support of judgment, said that hops being a commodity
so easily engrossed, required to be strictly regulated: the
practice of engrossing was innocent neither in the eyes of man
nor God.&nbsp; Lord Kenyon, though not giving judgment, spoke at
length on the matter.&nbsp; Hops were as much a
&ldquo;victual&rdquo; as salt, both being used for the
preservation of victuals; and he was old enough to recollect an
application being made to that court for an information for a
conspiracy to raise the price of salt at Droitwich.&nbsp; Mr.
Waddington was remanded to prison till the last day of
term.&nbsp; The judges then declared themselves of opinion that
there ought to be no new trial, and that there was no
defence.&nbsp; He was again remanded to prison till the ensuing
term, in spite of a spirited remonstrance, and a reference to the
case of Horne Tooke, whom Lord Kenyon characterised as a
&ldquo;bankrupt in character and fortune, and destitute of every
virtue and quality which could command respect.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the 8th of December, Mr. Waddington was found guilty, by a London
jury, of &ldquo;engrossing&rdquo; hops in the county of
Kent.&nbsp; While in prison he sold a ton of potatoes daily for
&frac12;d. per lb., and appropriated the proceeds to the benefit
of his poorer fellow prisoners.&nbsp; On the 25th of January,
1801, Mr. Waddington was finally brought up for judgment, and Mr.
Justice Grose declared that the court being unanimously of
opinion that the information on which Mr. Waddington had been
convicted was well supported at common law, he was sentenced to
pay a fine of &pound;500, and to be imprisoned one month.&nbsp;
On the 4th of June, Mr. Waddington having been confined <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>in
King&rsquo;s Bench prison upwards of twenty-seven weeks, at last
purged his crime, and went down to Maidstone.&nbsp; At Tunbridge
he was feasted at a superb dinner, and about two miles thence was
met by a number of hop planters, who took the horses from his
carriage, covered it with wreaths of hop bine, and had it drawn
by relays of men (twelve miles) to Maidstone.&nbsp; There he rode
in triumph through the streets; made a speech which was received
with immense acclamation; &ldquo;Waddington and the freedom of
commerce&rdquo; resounded through the streets; and a subscription
on his behalf was entered into.</p>
<p>1802&mdash;At the Summer Assizes, held before Mr. Justice
Lawrence and Mr. Justice Le Blanc, three men and one woman (for
privately stealing) were sentenced to death, but all
respited.&nbsp; Three privates in the 5th Dragoons were tried for
the murder of Samuel Porter, ostler at the New Inn, Pershore, and
one named Rankins was found guilty; but as the fatal blow was
struck in what might be considered an affray, some points were
reserved for the twelve judges, and his sentence was ultimately
commuted to transportation.</p>
<p>1803&mdash;At the Summer Assizes this year there were only
seven prisoners in both county and city for trial, and, of these,
three were acquitted.&nbsp; Of the remaining four, Thomas Beach
for uttering a forged &pound;5 note, and Elizabeth Guise for
robbing her master, Mr. Blizard of Stoulton, were sentenced to
death.&nbsp; Beach was executed; the woman reprieved.&nbsp; At
the same Assizes the Rev. J. F. Tonyn, rector of Alvechurch,
recovered &pound;300 damages from the Rev. Henry Lynam, his
curate, for criminal conversation with his wife.</p>
<p>1805&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 21&mdash;In the
Court of King&rsquo;s Bench an indictment was preferred by Mr.
Forrester, of Elmley, in this county, against Colonel Passingham
and a Mr. Edwards.&nbsp; Colonel Passingham had once been an
intimate friend of Mr. Forrester, had debauched his wife, and
carried her off, in January, 1803.&nbsp; Edwards was, also, once
Forrester&rsquo;s friend, but becoming a bankrupt, and prosecutor
being his opposing creditor, he became his implacable
enemy.&nbsp; Both then conspired to oblige the prosecutor to make
a very large settlement upon his wife, and he was actually
terrified into doing so by charges of horrible crimes.&nbsp;
These facts being proved on the part of the prosecution, the
defendants brought forward eleven witnesses to swear that Mr.
Forrester had actually been guilty of the offences
alleged&mdash;but they utterly broke down.&nbsp; The jury found
both prisoners guilty of the conspiracy.&nbsp; Being brought up
for judgment in the ensuing term, they were both sentenced to
three years&rsquo; imprisonment in Newgate; the additional
punishment of the pillory being specially <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>remitted,
lest their lives should be forfeited by any indignant violence on
the part of the populace.&nbsp; Mr. Forrester afterwards obtained
a divorce from his wife, she having contrived to visit Passingham
in prison, and assumed his name.</p>
<p>1807&mdash;At the Summer Assizes a special jury cause at Nisi
Prius, in which Sir John Geers Cottrell, Bart., as heir at law of
Mrs. Freeman of Henley Park, brought an action of ejectment
against Joseph Harris, Esq., of Stanford, the sole executor and
residuary legatee of that lady, appears to have excited much
interest.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict for defendant,
establishing Mr. Harris&rsquo;s right to a considerable estate in
the parish of Rock, and other property.&nbsp; Attorney for
defendant&mdash;Mr. Hyde, Worcester.&nbsp; At the Summer Assizes
the cause again came on, the plaintiff having obtained a new
trial.&nbsp; Some of the most celebrated counsel of the day were
engaged&mdash;Mr. Garrow being retained by the plaintiff, and Sir
Thomas Plumer for defendant.&nbsp; After a twenty-four
hours&rsquo; battle, the jury confirmed the verdict of the former
jury by a verdict for defendant.&nbsp; The finding gave general
satisfaction.</p>
<p>1808&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span>&mdash;At the
Worcester Summer Assizes this year was tried the cause of <span
class="smcap">Hill</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Smith</span>, an action brought to try the right of
the Corporation of Worcester to toll on wheat sold by sample, and
of course a matter of great interest to the agriculturists of the
county generally.&nbsp; The Corporation pleaded&mdash;&ldquo;1st,
that from time immemorial they had taken a pint of wheat out of
each bag, as a toll on wheat sold by sample in the market, and
afterwards brought into the city: 2nd, the same justification,
except that the taking was in the name of toll, and not as a
distress: 3rd, that the Corporation were seized in fee of the
Manor of Worcester, and that the toll was taken in respect of
such manor: 4th, that the Corporation had immemorially repaired
the horse and carriage road in the Corn Market, amongst others,
and by reason thereof had immemorially taken the toll on all
grain brought over the Corn Market to be delivered to a
buyer.&rdquo;&nbsp; The evidence fixed the custom of sale by
sample to have commenced in the year 1760.&nbsp; The learned
judge directed the jury to withdraw from their consideration the
question of toll traverse in respect of the manor, and toll
thorough (the last issue), the Corporation being unable to
support these issues, and desired them to consider whether the
grant (by charter, enabling them to toll wheat) was not
originally for all corn sold, both where the bulk or only a part
was brought into the market.&nbsp; The jury, after an hour and a
half&rsquo;s consideration, returned a verdict for the
Corporation on the <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>second and third issues, and for the agriculturists on
the others.&nbsp; Counsel for the agriculturists&mdash;Mr.
Sergeant Williams, Messrs. Jervis, Abbott, and Lord; attorney,
Mr. Hill: for the Corporation, Messrs. Dauncey, Wigley, Puller,
and Mence; attorney, Mr. Weller.</p>
<p>1808&mdash;At the Summer Assizes, William Reynolds, convicted
of an assault upon a female, was sentenced to be imprisoned
fourteen days, and to stand in the pillory at Tenbury.&nbsp; Ann
Green, for stealing brushes, was ordered to be privately whipped;
and four men, for divers crimes, were sentenced to fourteen
days&rsquo; imprisonment and a public whipping.</p>
<p>1809&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 14&mdash;Worcester
Summer Assizes.&nbsp; R. Baylis, churchwarden of Elmley Lovett,
was tried for painting up libels against the rector, the Rev. G.
Waldron, upon the walls of the parish church.&nbsp; They were
principally texts of scripture, the intended application of
which, however, could not be doubted.&nbsp; He was sentenced to
pay a fine, and to twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;Lent Assizes&mdash;A. <span
class="smcap">Lechmere</span>, <span class="smcap">Esq</span>.,
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Disson</span>, was a trial to
recover compensation for negligence in the defendant in the
manufacture of oil-cake.&nbsp; Mr. Lechmere had paid great
attention to the feeding of cattle, and had brought oil-cake into
much greater notice than it had been before.&nbsp; He purchased a
quantity from defendant, but finding his cattle did not thrive
upon it as he expected, he had it analysed; and several witnesses
declared, that due attention had not been paid to the clearing of
the seed by skreening and sifting it; so that a great deal of
extraneous matter was left in the cake.&mdash;Verdict for the
plaintiff: damages, &pound;50.</p>
<p>1812&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 20&mdash;A case of
assault and battery, <span class="smcap">Overbury</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Moseley</span>, tried in the
Worcester City Court.&nbsp; It arose out of a street row, which
occurred in the previous November.&nbsp; Overbury and another
insulted some lady in the Foregate Street, and Moseley came up to
her help, and gave Overbury a thorough thrashing, for which he
brought this plaint.&nbsp; The mayor having impartially summed
up, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.&nbsp;
Defendant conducted his own cause.&nbsp; Complainant was
represented by Mr. Sockett, an attorney of Worcester, who exerted
himself for his client beyond his strength, became ill, and soon
afterwards died.</p>
<p>1812&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Hill</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Smith</span> in error, having been argued before
the Court of Exchequer.&nbsp; Sir J. Mansfield, after many
delays, now gave judgment.&nbsp; The court held that a sale by
sample was not a legal contract for the sale of anything
whatever, and that the lord or superior of an open market was not
entitled to any toll on <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>commodities not brought in
bulk.&nbsp; A sale by sample had been held by Lord Coke, and
other great law authorities, to be illegal, as contrary to the
principle and object for which a market was established.&nbsp;
The verdict for the Corporation (obtained at Worcester Summer
Assizes, 1808) was therefore reversed, and the cause remitted to
the court below to ascertain the amount of damages the plaintiff
was entitled to for the trespass committed in taking his corn;
which were, of course, merely nominal.</p>
<p>1814&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span>&mdash;At the
Hereford Summer Assizes was tried <span class="smcap">Ford</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Racster</span>, being an action
brought by the executors of Dr. Ford, as Rector of Cradley,
Herefordshire, against Miss Racster, of Worcester, to try the
question of the liability of blackpoles to tithe.&nbsp; It was
argued for defendant, that these blackpoles, being more than
twenty years&rsquo; growth, were timber trees; but the jury
decided that they were not, according to the custom of the
country, and thereupon verdict was entered for plaintiff, and
damages assessed at &pound;100, being for eleven years&rsquo;
fallage.</p>
<p>1816&mdash;At the Lent Assizes was tried an action for libel,
brought by the Rev. Joseph Shapland against Richard Mug Mence,
Esq.&nbsp; Verdict for plaintiff.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Shapland
pleaded guilty to an indictment for an assault.&nbsp; At the
ensuing assizes he was sentenced to six months&rsquo;
imprisonment, and to enter into recognizances to keep the peace
for seven years, himself in &pound;500, and two sureties in
&pound;250 each.&nbsp; Mr. Shapland was Vicar of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, and had some unhappy disputes with his wife, to
settle which Mr. Mence had been called in as a mutual
friend.&nbsp; After a while, conceiving Mrs. Shapland to have
been ill-treated, Mr. Mence took her part very decidedly, and
refused to sit in company with Mr. Shapland.&nbsp; Mr. S. at this
was greatly exasperated; and meeting Mr. Mence one day walking
near the Guildhall, he struck him several times with a heavy
walking stick.&nbsp; Mr. Mence received the blows on his arm,
which was severely injured.&nbsp; Mr. M. afterwards published a
pamphlet, containing a long detail of Mr. Shapland&rsquo;s family
jars, and the part he had himself taken therein; and this was the
libel complained of.&nbsp; In November, 1812, Mr. Mence was
called up for judgment in the King&rsquo;s Bench, and sentenced
by Lord Ellenborough to six months&rsquo; imprisonment, and
afterwards to find sureties to keep the peace, himself in
&pound;1,000, and two sureties of &pound;500 each.&nbsp; The two
gentlemen were thus both imprisoned at the same time&mdash;the
one in the city, and the other in the county gaol.</p>
<p>1817&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, held before Mr. Justice Park
and <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Mr.
Justice Burrough, no less than twenty prisoners were sentenced to
death, most of them for sheep stealing; but they were all
afterwards reprieved.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;At the Lent Assizes this year, the trial of Joseph
Steers, a respectable tradesman of Worcester, and six others,
charged with being concerned in the &ldquo;freemen&rsquo;s
riots,&rdquo; and the demolition of the buildings upon
Pitchcroft, created the most intense interest, and at one part of
the proceedings there was an absolute tumult in court, so great
was the crush of people.&nbsp; The history of these riots is as
follows: In 1817 the &ldquo;popular mind&rdquo; of Worcester was
much agitated and incensed by buildings being erected on the
corner of Pitchcroft Ham, nearest to the city, and known as
Little Pitchcroft.&nbsp; The citizens viewed any encroachment on
this lung of the city with commendable jealousy, as it was their
principal resort for amusement and promenade; besides which, each
freeman had some property in the Ham, having a right of pasturage
thereon.&nbsp; A meeting was accordingly called in August, at the
Hoppole Inn, to protect the rights of the freemen in this
matter.&nbsp; Richard Spooner, Esq., then exceedingly active in
all popular movements in Worcester, was called to the chair, and
a committee was appointed, who issued notices to the parties who
had built upon the Ham to remove their erections before the 29th
of September.&nbsp; On the 15th of September, however, the
committee met, and agreed that as the removal of the whole
buildings would be attended with great loss to a charity which
derived considerable revenue from the wharfs, &amp;c., it would
be more desirable only to remove those buildings and fences which
were most obnoxious.&nbsp; On this decision being made known, the
populace determined to take the matter into their own hands; and
on the morning of the 29th assembled in large numbers, and
commenced the demolition of such of the fences and buildings as
were not strong enough to resist their efforts.&nbsp; The mayor
came down to the spot and read the Riot Act, but nobody took any
heed of his worship, who, with the magistrates, then began to
swear in everybody as special constables&mdash;the said
&ldquo;specials&rdquo; standing by and looking on at the
demolition, very anxious to keep the peace, but not venturing to
interrupt the mob.&nbsp; At last some of the yeomanry assembled,
but being pelted with stones, they retreated to the Star and
Garter yard, and made no further appearance.&nbsp; The demolition
was concluded next morning; everybody saying that it was most
disgraceful, but nevertheless glad that it was done.&nbsp; Steers
and other persons, who had taken part in the work of destruction,
were indicted (under <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>statutes which had recently been
passed) for a capital offence; but Mr. Jervis, counsel for the
prosecutor, Mr. John Edmunds, declared that that was only done in
order to have a foundation to recover the damages he had
sustained during the riot.&nbsp; After two witnesses had been
examined, Mr. Justice Burrough, who presided, said there was
enough evidence to convict the whole prisoners of a capital
offence, and advised them to throw themselves on the mercy of the
court.&nbsp; This course they adopted; and his lordship then
discharged them, on entering into recognizances of &pound;100
each, to keep the peace for twelve months.&nbsp; The greatest
possible interest had been made on behalf of these parties; and
Lord Deerhurst, whose efforts were supposed to have contributed
greatly to the lenity with which they were treated, was almost
overwhelmed, on leaving the court, by the tumultuous approbation
of the populace.&nbsp; The mob endeavoured to drag Mr. Justice
Burrough in triumph through the city, on leaving for Stafford;
but his lordship instantly called in the aid of the javelin men,
and threatened to commit the foremost of the crowd.&nbsp; To
finish the story here; immediately after these assizes, the
agitation about the encroachments was recommenced, and Mr. Thomas
Carden, one of the six masters, put forth a statement that the
four acres in dispute were the gift of Thomas Wylde, Esq.,
formerly of the Commandry in the city of Worcester, to the
Corporation; and the rents and profits of this land had been
uniformly applied to the benefit of the Free School, and Trinity
Alms Houses.&nbsp; Having in 1796 let out this land in lots, the
six masters had been enabled to increase the pay, to twenty-nine
old women, from 3s. to 6s. per month, which was a thing much more
worth doing than to allow one thousand freemen the pasturage
thereon, from Old Midsummer Day to Old Candlemas Day.&nbsp; A
common hall was shortly afterwards held, at which the committee
appointed for protecting the freemen&rsquo;s rights made their
report.&nbsp; It was read by R. Spooner, Esq., and stated that
they had ordered entries to be made on two of the plots in Little
Pitchcroft; the result of which had been, that actions had been
brought against the enterers, and the <i>venue</i> changed by the
plaintiffs to Gloucester.&nbsp; The committee now wanted to know
whether the claims of the freemen were to be contested or
abandoned, as in the former case it would be necessary that the
city generally should enter into a subscription to provide the
sinews of war.&nbsp; The report was adopted, and a subscription
forthwith commenced.&nbsp; A motion to make terms with the six
masters was rejected.&nbsp; Just before the trial came on,
however, the matter was settled by arrangement, <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>concessions
being made on either side; and buildings cover the greater part
of &ldquo;Little Pitchcroft&rdquo; to this day.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;At the Summer Assizes, John Grindley, of
Bromsgrove, was tried on a charge of wilfully murdering Thomas
Mannering.&nbsp; They had quarrelled in a public house, gone out
into the street to fight, but there made up their differences,
and sat upon the public stocks, drinking some beer.&nbsp; While
thus occupied, Grindley stabbed Mannering twice so severely that
he died next day.&nbsp; He was found guilty of manslaughter, and
sentenced to six months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, John Burton was convicted of
the murder of one Jaunty, in Worcester, on the 30th of July,
1819.&nbsp; Parties who had been employed by the Excise to seize
some malt, were met at the back of the Hoppole Inn by a number of
persons from the neighbouring public houses, and a general battle
commenced; the interest of which at length concentrated itself in
a fight between Burton and Jaunty.&nbsp; They had several rounds,
and Jaunty at last getting the better of his antagonist, Burton
ran off to his house, but presently returned with a pike, and
stabbed Jaunty right through the heart and lungs.&nbsp; Burton
was, however, reprieved on a point of law.&nbsp; At these
assizes, twenty-seven persons were sentenced to death (one a
woman, for stealing thirty-nine yards of bombazine from a shop at
Stourbridge), but all were reprieved, except one for highway
robbery.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 24&mdash;A curious
application was made to the Lord Chancellor by the guardians of
Sir Roger Gresley, a young man of twenty, and a ward of Chancery,
to restrain the Earl and Countess of Coventry, and the Hon. John
Coventry, from encouraging a marriage between Sir Roger and Lady
Sophia Coventry, daughter of the earl, aged seventeen.&nbsp;
There had been negociations for a marriage, rent rolls having
been handed to the guardians, &amp;c.; but as no settlement could
be made on the bride till Sir Roger was of age, the matter was
postponed.&nbsp; The court took it in dudgeon that anything
should have been done towards disposing of its ward in matrimony
without its license, &amp;c.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 13&mdash;A rule
moved for in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench on behalf of the
magistrates of Worcestershire, to compel the inhabitants of
Ombersley to pay &pound;150 into the hands of the clerk of the
peace for the repairs of Hawford Bridge.&nbsp; The Ombersley
people replied that they were going to repair, and that &pound;50
would be quite sufficient to do all that was needed.&nbsp; The
rule was granted, but enlarged to the next term to admit of time
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>for the
repairs being effectively carried out by the inhabitants of
Ombersley themselves, if they so pleased.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, before Mr. Baron Jarrow, an
action was brought by a schoolmaster at Dudley, a little deformed
man, named Hilliard, to recover damages from Mr. Badger for
knocking his hat off at the theatre, because he would not take it
off when the national anthem was being played.&nbsp; Mr. Badger,
in the zeal of his loyalty, not only knocked the unfortunate
pedagogue&rsquo;s hat off, but the pedagogue himself off the
bench; and Mr. Baron Jarrow, in summing up, intimated that he
thought he was rather to be commended than otherwise, and
pictured to the jury &ldquo;the glorious sight of a whole
audience in a theatre paying a just tribute of veneration to
their sovereign.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict for
plaintiff: damages, one farthing.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span>&mdash;At the
Midsummer Assizes was tried, <span class="smcap">Jarratt</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">the Mayor and Corporation of
Evesham</span>, being an attempt to establish the right of any
person who had served a freeman of that borough for an
apprenticeship of seven years to be himself admitted a
freeman.&nbsp; The Corporation admitted that if the whole service
had been within the borough the custom was to admit; but if the
master and apprentice had lived elsewhere any period of the time
then the right of admission failed.&nbsp; A verdict was entered
for the Corporation.</p>
<p>1823&mdash;Two men, named Oliver and Skinner, convicted at the
Easter City Sessions of a most unprovoked assault on three
journeymen carpenters going home one dark night in January, and
sentenced&mdash;Oliver to six months, and Skinner to nine
months&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; These two fellows were part of
a fraternity calling themselves &ldquo;lambs,&rdquo; who used to
infest the streets of Worcester at night for the sole purpose of
annoying more peaceably disposed persons.&nbsp; At the trial they
brought a number of witnesses to prove an <i>alibi</i>, but
utterly failed, and disclosed the most unblushing perjury in lieu
thereof.</p>
<p>1823&mdash;William Taylor, a working stone mason, recovered
&pound;120 damages in the Sheriff&rsquo;s Court, for a fright
into which he had been put by Henry Geast Dugdale, Esq., a
magistrate of Worcestershire, living at Bordesley Park.&nbsp; He
was one of some workmen who were erecting a stone lodge for
defendant, who one day, when they had nearly finished, came up
and peremptorily ordered them off his premises.&nbsp; He said he
had been told by his master not to leave till he had finished the
job; but Mr. Dugdale, foaming <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>with rage, presented his gun at him,
cocked it, and declared he would shoot Taylor presently, if he
were not gone; whereupon he dropped his chisel and mallet in a
terror, took to his heels, and had been declining in health ever
since&mdash;such had been the effect of the alarm upon his
nervous system.&nbsp; Mr. Dugdale, in addressing the jury, said
&ldquo;he once took a noble earl by the collar, and forced him
off his lands;&rdquo; and hereupon Lord Plymouth, writing to the
Worcester papers, said Mr. Dugdale no doubt meant himself, but
that the whole statement was entirely untrue.</p>
<p>1824&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes, before Mr. Justice
Littledale, was tried the cause of <span
class="smcap">Pierpoint</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Shapland</span>, in which Matthew Pierpoint, Esq.,
of Worcester, surgeon (and as it proved upon the trial, physician
also), brought an action for slander against Miss Susanna
Shapland, a lady then residing in College Green.&nbsp; The
damages were laid at &pound;5,000.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint had been
called in to attend Mrs. Isaacs, Miss Shapland&rsquo;s sister,
shortly before her death, and administered an emetic: after that
he ceased to attend her, and Miss Shapland afterwards told Mrs.
Henry Clifton that Mr. P. had treated her sister
improperly.&nbsp; Mr. Jervis was counsel for plaintiff, and Mr.
Russell for defendant.&nbsp; A verdict was returned for
plaintiff, with 39s. damages.&nbsp; This trial excited
extraordinary interest&mdash;ladies, to make sure of places,
going to the courts at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>1825&mdash;At the Lent Assizes an action for libel, against
<span class="smcap">Chalk and Holl</span>, was tried before Mr.
Justice Littledale.&nbsp; It was brought by a painter named
Davis, who had, by mistake, been described in a paragraph in the
<i>Worcester Herald</i> as concerned in a street row and an
assault upon a watchman.&nbsp; The party&rsquo;s name <i>was</i>
Davis, but not the one pointed at in the paragraph, and
defendants, finding their error, corrected it in the next paper
and apologised; nevertheless Davis persisted in the action, urged
thereto, as it came out in the trial, by his attorney, who had
undertaken that it should cost him nothing.&nbsp; The counsel
engaged were&mdash;for the plaintiff, Mr. Campbell (now Lord
Chief Justice Campbell); and for defendant, Mr. Russell.&nbsp;
The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff, as the judge told them
they must to do so, with damages one farthing.</p>
<p>1827&mdash;Summer Assizes, before Mr. Justice
Littledale.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The King</span> <i>v.</i>
<span class="smcap">Cooke</span> was an action against a draper,
at Dudley, of the most Radical cast, for publishing libels on His
Majesty&rsquo;s Government.&nbsp; The libels were placards
exhibited in the defendant&rsquo;s window during a <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>time of
great disturbance amongst the colliers, in May, 1826.&nbsp; The
case had been entered for trial at previous assizes, but put off
from time to time.&nbsp; The alleged libel in the placards was
the assertion that ministers were bringing starvation upon the
people by their measures.&nbsp; Mr. Whateley was for the
prosecution, and Mr. Campbell for the defence.&nbsp; The
appearance of the placards in the defendant&rsquo;s window having
been proved, Mr. Andrew Gracewood, doorkeeper at the Foreign
Office, was put in the box to prove that Earl Liverpool and
others mentioned in the handbills were at the time of their
publication ministers of state.&nbsp; Mr. Campbell, of course,
ridiculed the whole prosecution, and said Cooke was being made
the victim of private malice.&nbsp; The judge told the jury the
handbills were libellous, so they returned a verdict of
guilty.&nbsp; Cooke was only required to enter into sureties to
appear when called up.</p>
<p>1827&mdash;At the Lent Assizes this year there were nearly a
hundred prisoners for trial, and against twenty-four of them
sentence of death was recorded.</p>
<p>At these assizes was tried <span class="smcap">Agg</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Timbrell</span>, in which the
plaintiff recovered &pound;7 damages for the injury done to his
gig by the negligent driving of the defendant&rsquo;s
coachman.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Phillips was counsel for plaintiff,
and Mr. Taunton for defendant.&nbsp; The affair was chiefly
curious from the remark of defendant, who, when the accident
happened and Agg complained, said, &ldquo;Do you know who I
am?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Doctor Timbrell, Doctor of Divinity,
Archdeacon, and magistrate in two counties.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
talk to me, or I&rsquo;ll commit you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>1828&mdash;In November, this year, in the King&rsquo;s Bench,
a rule for a criminal information against the Rev. Humphry Price,
for issuing inflammatory handbills at the time of the late strike
between the Kidderminster weavers and their masters, was made
absolute.&nbsp; The Rev. gentleman appeared in court himself, and
avowed himself to be the author of the placards charged against
him.&nbsp; The cause against him was tried at the next Hereford
Lent Assizes.&nbsp; A number of verses, entitled &ldquo;<i>The
Complaint of a Kidderminster Weaver&rsquo;s Wife to her
Infant</i>,&rdquo; appeared to be most complained of; they ended
thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O cruel, cruel, cruel masters,<br />
Dare ye thus mock at our disasters?<br />
See parent, child, to phrenzy given,<br />
And dream yourselves of reaching heaven?</p>
<p>Rouse from your slumbers! count the price<br />
Of your own cursed avarice;<br />
And count it well, ere taught too late<br />
To dread than ours a far worse fate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Mr.
Campbell defended the Rev. gentleman, but he was found guilty,
and being brought up for judgment next term, was sentenced to
twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment, and adjudged to pay the
costs.</p>
<p>1829&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes, before Mr. Baron Vaughan,
John Hunter, Esq., of Pershore, was tried for feloniously
altering a deed.&nbsp; A true bill had been returned against Mr.
Hunter at the Lent Assizes, but he was enlarged till the
Midsummer Assizes on very heavy bail.&nbsp; The respectability of
Mr. Hunter, who but for this charge would this very year have
been High Sheriff of the County, caused the intensest interest to
be felt in the trial, and the courts were thronged to
suffocation.&nbsp; Mr. Campbell, K.C., Mr. Sergeant Ludlow, Mr.
Carwood, and Mr. Godson, were the counsel for the prosecution;
and Mr. Taunton, Mr. Sergeant Russell, and Mr. C. Phillips,
assisted the defendant, who, as the law then stood, was obliged
to address the jury himself, and could only avail himself of
counsel in cross-examination, this being a misdemeanour.&nbsp;
The charge against Mr. Hunter was that he had erased the words
&ldquo;part of&rdquo; from a deed which he held, and the effect
of the erasure would be to put him in possession of the
<i>whole</i> of the premises to which it referred.&nbsp; In fact,
in 1825 he brought an action on the strength of this deed to
recover the whole of the premises, but permitted himself to be
non-suited.&nbsp; Mr. Hunter, in the written defence he handed in
to be read to the jury, contented himself with denying any
knowledge of how the erasure came about, and that it existed in
the deed when it first came into his possession, he having bought
the property as an entire property.&nbsp; The evidence given, and
some of the witnesses adduced by the prosecution, were of a very
doubtful character; and after the long array of witnesses which
Mr. Hunter called to speak to a long life of unblemished
uprightness, the jury said they would not trouble his lordship to
sum up, and Mr. Hunter must be <i>honourably acquitted</i>.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;At the Summer Assizes, before Mr. Sergeant
Bosanquet, came on the case of <span class="smcap">Chalk and
Holl</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, M.P.,
being an action to recover &pound;13. 8s. 6d. for printing
electioneering squibs on Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s behalf, at the
election of 1826.&nbsp; They were written and ordered by some of
Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s agents and solicitors, and his object in
resisting the claim was to disown any personal connection with
them.&nbsp; The matter was referred, at the judge&rsquo;s
request, to Mr. Holroyd; and he awarded the sum claimed to the
plaintiffs, holding Mr. Robinson liable; Mr. Brampton proving
that the orders came from his committee room.</p>
<h3><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>THE
ODDINGLEY MURDER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> annals of crime record few
tragedies so fearful in their enactment, so mysterious in their
present concealment, so singular in their ultimate discovery as
the Oddingley murder.&nbsp; A clergyman is shot at noon-day,
while walking in his own fields&mdash;the assassin and the motive
are perfectly known, yet he eludes justice, and suddenly and for
ever disappears.&nbsp; Some of the men to whom common rumour
points as the probable instigators of the crime, pass to their
account, and make no sign.&nbsp; At last, when twenty-four years
have elapsed, the body of the murderer is strangely discovered,
in a state of preservation and under circumstances which leave no
room to doubt that he was himself murdered by those who had hired
him to commit the crime they were afraid to perpetrate with their
own hands.</p>
<p>Thus circumstance combined with circumstance to increase the
romance of this tale of blood, and invest it with a fearful
interest, creating an unparalleled excitement, not only in this
neighbourhood but throughout the whole country.&nbsp; People
delighted to point to it, as showing how, with silent footfall,
justice ever tracks the murderer&rsquo;s steps, and at last
exposes his guilt to the gaze of day, with whatever care and
midnight secrecy he has sought to hide and cover it.&nbsp; But it
showed, also, that the punishment of murder, as of other crimes,
is sometimes postponed to a more perfect time of retribution, and
that men doubly dyed with the blood of others&mdash;shed under
the influence of passions the most detestable&mdash;avarice,
hate, and fear&mdash;can walk their lives long among their
fellows with a smooth brow, and at last placidly turn their faces
to the <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>wall without, to outward seeming, one pang of remorse
or outcry of conscience.</p>
<p>The first notice of this terrible crime appeared in the
Worcester papers of June 26, 1806, and is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rev. G. Parker, rector of Oddingley, in
this county, was, on Tuesday evening last, most inhumanly
murdered in a field near his own dwelling house.&nbsp; The
perpetrator of this cruel deed discharged a gun at the
unfortunate gentleman, the contents of which entered his right
side; and afterwards, in a manner peculiarly atrocious, with the
butt end of his gun fractured his skull.&nbsp; An inquest was
held the following day, before R. Barneby, Esq., coroner, when
the jury returned this verdict&mdash;&lsquo;Wilful murder, by
some person or persons unknown.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Parker was an amiable man and benevolent to the poor, but
there had been an unhappy dispute between him and his
parishioners about the tithes, which was perfectly well
understood to have been the cause prompting to his death.&nbsp;
His predecessor had been in the habit of compounding with the
farmers for his tithes, they giving him in lieu thereof
&pound;135 per annum.&nbsp; Mr. Parker, considering this
inadequate, proposed raising it to &pound;150.&nbsp; Captain
Evans, one of his parishioners, however, prevailed on the farmers
to join him in resisting this proposal, and Mr. Parker, in
consequence, collected the tithe.&nbsp; After he had done so for
two years, the farmers, finding themselves losers by the system,
offered to accede to the proposal previously made.&nbsp; Mr.
Parker told them he was still willing to abide by it, but
required, as he had been at an expense of &pound;150 in erecting
a barn, and making other arrangements for collecting the tithe,
that they should, in addition, repay him that sum, but this was
refused.</p>
<p>The magistrates, immediately after the murder, issued a bill,
offering a reward of fifty guineas for the apprehension of the
murderer, and minutely described the person and dress of Richard
Hemming, a carpenter of Droitwich, who was at once suspected as
the perpetrator of this fearful crime.&nbsp; The report of the
gun was heard by several parties, and two persons from Worcester
saw Hemming escaping over some fields in the neighbourhood of the
spot&mdash;indeed he was distinctly traced to a wood at Lench,
but there all trace of him was entirely lost, and it was thought
that he had left the country in security.&nbsp; A free pardon was
offered at the time by Government to any accomplices in the
murder who would become king&rsquo;s evidence.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>In
June, 1807, a man, who had enlisted into the marines, was
detained by the magistrates at Plymouth on suspicion of being
Hemming.&nbsp; Mr. Carden immediately despatched parties to
ascertain the truth of the matter, but it proved to be a case of
mistaken identity.&nbsp; The affair, though public notice of it
was hushed, was never forgotten&mdash;the country people had
their beliefs and traditions concerning it, and though it was
confidently affirmed by some that Hemming had been seen alive in
America, the real truth was more than guessed at.&nbsp; It was by
some firmly believed that Hemming had been murdered by the
parties who employed him to assassinate Mr. Parker, and they
themselves seemed scarcely anxious to avoid the imputation.&nbsp;
Captain Evans, whom all pointed at as being the principal
instigator of the assassination, constantly kept standing upon
his estate a certain clover rick, which he had made three days
only after Mr. Parker&rsquo;s murder, and when he parted with the
estate two years afterwards to a Mr. Barnett, this rick was still
kept standing.&nbsp; The general belief was that Hemming&rsquo;s
body had been buried beneath this rick, and in 1816
Hemming&rsquo;s widow (then married again) made a deposition
before the Droitwich magistrates of her conviction that this was
the case.&nbsp; A search warrant was granted, but in that same
night the clover rick mysteriously disappeared, and though the
ground which it had covered was carefully dug up, nothing was
discovered.&nbsp; Captain Evans, at the time of Mr.
Parker&rsquo;s murder, lived upon the Church Farm, Oddingley; but
in 1808 he went to reside on a small estate called New House,
upon the confines of the two parishes of Hadsor and
Oddingley.&nbsp; Here he remained till 1826, when he went to
Droitwich, and there lived till his death, which occurred in
1829; he was then ninety-four years of age.&nbsp; He was formerly
a captain in the 89th Foot, and received half pay up to the day
of his death.&nbsp; He was a magistrate of the borough of
Droitwich.</p>
<p>It may be well conceived that all idea of any further
discovery of the circumstances under which this terrible crime
was committed had long been given up, and that the discovery of
the skeleton of Hemming created the most startling
surprise.&nbsp; On the 21st January, 1830, a carpenter named
Burton was engaged in removing a barn upon the Netherwood Farm,
Oddingley, which, at the time of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s murder, was
occupied by Mr. Thomas Clewes.&nbsp; He had begun to remove the
foundation when he met with a pair of shoes and carpenter&rsquo;s
rule.&nbsp; The story of Hemming immediately recurred to his
mind, and, carefully covering up again what he had found, he went
to the magistrates of Droitwich and the coroner of the county <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>(Mr.
William Smith).&nbsp; The further investigation of the spot was
very carefully conducted by the neighbouring magistrates and Mr.
Pierpoint of Worcester; and the whole skeleton of a man, of just
such height and make as Hemming was known to have been, was
disclosed to view.&nbsp; His former wife particularly identified
the remains by the mouth and teeth, and declared her firm belief
to be that the rule which Burton had found was that which Hemming
used customarily to carry in his pocket.&nbsp; The bones of the
skull had been beaten into many pieces.&nbsp; An inquest was
commenced upon these remains on the following Tuesday, and, by
adjournment, on the Friday; at the close of which sitting, Thomas
Clewes was taken into custody on suspicion of having been
concerned in the murder of Hemming, and in the course of the next
day he expressed his desire to make a confession.&nbsp; The
coroner and jury accordingly went to him in the County Gaol,
where, with great composure, he gave the following account of the
circumstances under which Hemming was himself murdered on the
evening of the day after that on which he had shot Mr.
Parker.&nbsp; Whether it is the absolute truth or not, coming as
it did from an accomplice, must always be a matter of doubt, but
it is at any rate all that will now be known of this deed of
terror.</p>
<h4>CLEWES&rsquo;S CONFESSION.</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the morrow morning after the parson was
shot (I mean the Rev. Mr. Parker, Rector of Oddingley), it was on
Bromsgrove fair day&mdash;I cannot recollect exactly the
year&mdash;about seven o&rsquo;clock, George Bankes came down to
me, and says, &lsquo;We have got Hemming, who shot the parson, at
our house (meaning Captain Evans&rsquo;s) this morning, and I do
not know what to do with him&mdash;will you let him come down
here?&rsquo;&nbsp; I said, &lsquo;I will not have him here, nor
have nothing to do with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bankes then went
off.&nbsp; Bankes said, &lsquo;he is lurking down in the
meadows.&rsquo;&nbsp; I went up to Oddingley about eleven
o&rsquo;clock in the day to Mr. Jones&rsquo;s; Mr. Jones is dead,
and Mr. Nash lives in the farm now.&nbsp; As I went up the road
side, I suppose he (meaning Captain Evans) kept sight of me all
the way.&nbsp; The Captain called to me; he was in his garden,
close by the road side; he followed me out of the garden into the
field, and said he wanted to speak with me.&nbsp; He said,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had Hemming at our house this morning, and
something must be done by him; he is lurking down towards your
house now; I ordered him to get into your buildings by day-time,
if possible, or at the edge of night, that you (meaning witness)
might not see him, or any of your family, and somewhat must be
done by him.&nbsp; I shall come down to your house at night, and
bring somebody with me, and we must give the poor devil some
money, or do something with him, and send him off; will you get
up and come to the barn? it won&rsquo;t detain you a
minute.&rsquo;&nbsp; I refused coming, and said, &lsquo;I did not
like to come.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Captain said, &lsquo;it can make
no odds to you&mdash;you need not be afraid to come at eleven
o&rsquo;clock; just come out, it will make no difference to you
at <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>all;
if you don&rsquo;t come I shall be afraid of your
dogs.&rsquo;&nbsp; I went out at the back door and down to the
barn door, as the clock struck eleven.&nbsp; There was the
Captain and James Taylor, and a third, whom I thought and
believed to be George Bankes.&nbsp; They went into the barn (I
mean the Captain, Taylor, and George Bankes), and I with them; I
believed it to be Bankes; he had on a smock-frock; as soon as the
Captain came into the barn, he calls, &lsquo;Holloa, Hemming,
where be&rsquo;est?&rsquo; not very loud; Hemming spoke, and said
&lsquo;Yes, Sir;&rsquo; Taylor and the Captain then stepped on
the mow, where Hemming was lying, which was not higher than my
knee; the Captain pulled a lantern from under his coat, or out of
his pocket; myself and George Bankes were then on the
thrashing-floor; the Captain said, &lsquo;Get up, Hemming, I have
got something for thee;&rsquo; Hemming was at the time covered up
with straw; he was rising up on end, as if he had been lying on
his back; as he rose up, Taylor up with a blood-stick, and hit
him on the head two or three blows; I (witness) said, &lsquo;This
is bad work&mdash;if I had known you should not have had me
here;&rsquo; the Captain said, &lsquo;He has got enough;&rsquo;
Taylor and the Captain came down off the mow directly; Taylor
said, &lsquo;What is to be done with him now?&rsquo; the Captain
said, &lsquo;D&mdash;n his body, we must not take him out of
doors, somebody will see us, mayhap.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not very
dark.&nbsp; Taylor went out of doors, and fetched a spade from
somewhere; it was no spade of mine; and Taylor and the Captain
said, &lsquo;We will soon put him safe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Taylor then
searched round the bay of the barn on the contrary side where it
was done, and found holes which dogs and rats had scratched; he
threw out a spadeful or two, and cleared away from the foundation
side of the wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;This will do for him,&rsquo;
Taylor said to the Captain, who stood by and lighted him the
while.&nbsp; Bankes and myself were still on the floor of the
barn.&nbsp; Then the Captain and Taylor got upon the mow, and
pulled Hemming down to the front of the mow.&nbsp; The Captain
said to Taylor, &lsquo;Catch hold of him,&rsquo; and they dragged
him across the floor, and into the hole they had dug for him in
the opposite bay, and Taylor soon covered it up.&nbsp; I cannot
tell whether he was put in on his back or not; I never stepped
into the bay from the floor; I thought I should have died where I
was; the Captain said to Taylor, &lsquo;Well done, boy,
I&rsquo;ll give thee another glass or two of brandy.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Captain said to me on the floor when we went out,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you anything; d&mdash;n your body,
don&rsquo;t ever split.&rsquo;&nbsp; All four were present at
this; we then parted; the Captain darkened his lantern; the
Captain, Bankes, and Taylor, went away towards Oddingley; I went
to bed; the whole did not occupy half an hour; Hemming had his
clothes on; Hemming never moaned nor groaned after he was first
struck; there was no blood&mdash;not a spot on the floor; nothing
else was done that night.&nbsp; On the 26th of June I was at
Pershore fair; George Bankes came to me in the afternoon, between
four and five; he called me up an entry at the Plough, and said,
&lsquo;Here is some money for you that Hemming was to have
had.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. John Barnett was with Bankes then, Bankes
and Barnett each of them gave me money, but I do not recollect
how much I had from each; I did not count it until I got
home.&nbsp; They said when they gave it me, &lsquo;Be sure you
don&rsquo;t split.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was no more said about it
that night.&nbsp; It was in two parcels, in all between &pound;26
and &pound;27, and all in bills; there was no silver.&nbsp; I put
it all in one pocket.&nbsp; This was to have taken Hemming off,
as Bankes and Barnett informed me.&nbsp; A few days after, I was
at the <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>Captain&rsquo;s; he sent for me by my own son, John
Clewes, then about seven years old.&nbsp; When I got to the
Captain&rsquo;s, I found him alone; he said to me, if I kept my
peace, and did not split, I should never want for &pound;5.&nbsp;
I never received any money from him afterwards.&nbsp; On the same
day, in the parlour of the Captain&rsquo;s house, Catherine
Bankes came to me, and went down on her knees, in great distress,
and begged and prayed of me not to say anything, as she feared
the Captain had done a bad job, and that they would all come to
be hanged if I spoke.&nbsp; I promised her I never would say
anything.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Bankes was a farm bailiff; Taylor died about 1816, having
lived some time in infamous notoriety at Droitwich.&nbsp;
Barnett, at the time of the murder, was only bailiff for his
mother, but had since become an opulent farmer.&nbsp; Clewes
himself failed three or four years after the murder, and had
since been engaged as a labourer or woodman.]</p>
<p>A great many witnesses were examined at the inquest, who spoke
to expressions of hatred and malice used by Captain Evans,
Barnett, Bankes, and Clewes, with regard to Mr. Parker, and many
trifling circumstances which tended to implicate them in the
disappearance of Hemming, and corroborate Clewes&rsquo;s
confession.&nbsp; The jury, after five days of most elaborate
investigation, returned a verdict of wilful murder against Thomas
Clewes and George Bankes; and further found that John Barnett,
late of the parish of Oddingley, farmer, was an accessary to such
murder before the fact.</p>
<p>These three persons were accordingly put upon their trial at
the ensuing March Assizes, before Mr. Justice Littledale.&nbsp; A
true bill was found against Clewes as principal in the second
degree, and against Barnett and Bankes as accessaries before the
fact to the murder of the Rev. George Parker, by Richard
Hemming.&nbsp; Mr. Curwood was the leading counsel for the
prosecution, Mr. Sergeant Ludlow for Clewes, Mr. Campbell, K.C.,
for Bankes, and Mr. Taunton, K.C., for Barnett.&nbsp; An
objection was taken to the prisoners pleading as accessaries to a
murder, the principal in which had not been found guilty; and
this objection being allowed, Clewes and Bankes were arraigned as
principals, and Barnett as accessary before the fact to the
murder of Richard Hemming.&nbsp; Clewes was first put upon his
trial alone.&nbsp; The evidence of the finding of the body of
Hemming having been given, and its identification completed, many
witnesses were examined to speak to expressions of the prisoner,
tending to show that he had been anxious to procure the death of
Mr. Parker; and expressions used by Hemming, showing that he had
been employed to do some foul deed at Oddingley.&nbsp; It was
proved, too, that Clewes and Hemming had been frequently in one
another&rsquo;s company prior to the murder.&nbsp; Last of all,
after a sharp struggle on the part of the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>prisoner&rsquo;s counsel to prevent it, Clewes&rsquo;s
confession was put in and read.&nbsp; Sergeant Ludlow briefly
addressed the learned judge, urging that Clewes was entitled to
his acquittal, as his confession stood uncontradicted, and that
did not prove him to have been a principal in the crime.&nbsp;
The court decided that the matter must be left to the jury, and
to them the prisoner declined saying anything; nor did the law
then admit of counsel addressing the jury in defence.&nbsp; The
jury, after a short summing up, returned a verdict of
&ldquo;Guilty as an accessary after the fact;&rdquo; but Mr.
Justice Littledale observing that they had only to inquire
whether he was guilty of aiding and abetting in the murder, they
returned a general verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
crown refused to call any evidence on the coroner&rsquo;s
inquisition, or against Barnett and Bankes, so they were all
discharged.&nbsp; The expenses attending the prosecution amounted
to between &pound;700 and &pound;800.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, before Mr. Baron Bolland, was
tried the cause of <span class="smcap">The King</span> <i>v.</i>
<span class="smcap">Dineley</span>, in which Mr. Francis Dineley,
solicitor, practising at Pershore, was found guilty of conspiring
with one William Loxley, deceased, to defraud Nicholas Marshall
of &pound;2,000.&nbsp; The transaction took place so far back as
1804, when Loxley and Dineley induced Mr. Nicholas Marshall to
advance the sum of &pound;2,000 on what it was alleged they
<i>knew</i> to be defective security, and he lost the whole of
it.&nbsp; Mr. Campbell made a long speech in defence, alleging
that the defect in the security might not have been known to his
client, and remarking strongly on the long time which had
elapsed.&nbsp; The case for the prosecution rested mainly on
letters written by Dineley to Loxley.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 21&mdash;In the
Arches Court, judgment was delivered in the suit of <span
class="smcap">Barnett</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Rev</span>. <span class="smcap">William Baldwin
Bonaker</span>, being a complaint on the part of some of the
inhabitants of Church Honeybourne against their clergyman for
neglect of duty, such as continued absence from the parish.&nbsp;
Sir J. Nicholl, the judge, declared the evidence insufficient,
and condemned the promoters of the suit in full costs.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 20&mdash;At the
Michaelmas Sessions were tried the Kidderminster rioters.&nbsp;
True bills were found for riot and assault against ten carpet
weavers, and the case for the prosecution was conducted by Mr.
Evans and Mr. Lea; Mr. Godson and Mr. Lumley appearing for the
prisoners.&nbsp; Three of them, named Lamsdale, Green, and
Stephens, were first tried for being concerned in an attack on
the prison, on the second day of the disturbances, and with
assaulting <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>William Hopkins, a constable; but they were acquitted,
to the great surprise of the court.&nbsp; Six men were next tried
for the attack on Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s factory, and for very
ill-treatment of a man named Edwards, working there at low
prices.&nbsp; He was left by the mob, thrust into the ashpit of
one of the furnaces, more than half dead.&nbsp; Phaizy and
Hopkins, the men principally concerned in this assault, were
sentenced to six months&rsquo; imprisonment&mdash;Lamsdale to
three months, and Price to two months&rsquo; imprisonment; and
all to enter into sureties to keep the peace.&nbsp; Other two
were acquitted.&nbsp; In three other cases verdicts were taken by
consent, and almost nominal punishments inflicted.&nbsp; Mr.
Godson&rsquo;s strenuous exertions in these cases laid the
foundation for his subsequent popularity in the borough of
Kidderminster.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 18&mdash;At the
trial of one of the prisoners at the City Michaelmas Sessions,
Mr. Curwood, his barrister, handed in a protest against the
jurisdiction of the court, because it was not constituted
according to the charter of James I, which required that the
recorder&mdash;&ldquo;one learned and discreet man, learned in
the laws&rdquo;&mdash;should always preside at gaol
deliveries.&nbsp; Earl Coventry and his ancestors had long been
recorders of Worcester, and seldom (or never) present at Quarter
Sessions.&nbsp; The magistrates refused to receive the
protest.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;The cause list at the Midsummer Assizes this year
contained thirty-one cases for trial, and two of them excited
much interest.&nbsp; The first was an action brought by the Rev.
Edward Herbert against a Mr. Heath, for an assault, in which Mr.
Campbell and Mr. Whateley were for plaintiff, and Mr. Charles
Phillips for defendant.&nbsp; For the prosecution it was merely
proved that Heath struck Herbert some dozen blows with a
horsewhip in Broad Street, Worcester, on the 23rd of the previous
February.&nbsp; One witness heard Heath say the words,
&ldquo;that &mdash; my father, and you consider yourself well
horsewhipped for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Charles Phillips made a
very long and powerful speech for the defence, stating to the
jury that if the prosecutor had dared himself to come into the
box, he would have forced him to confess that he had not only
broken his pledge to Mr. Heath&rsquo;s sister, but had slandered
his buried father in the most outrageous and unbearable
manner.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Patteson told the jury that all they
had to do was to say whether Heath had committed the assault, and
so they returned a verdict of &ldquo;Guilty;&rdquo; but no
sentence was passed, though the affidavits of defendant were
ready, and Mr. Justice Patteson himself pointed out to Mr. <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Phillips an
error in the record, no doubt with a view of getting rid of the
case.</p>
<p>The other case was a charge against Mr. Francis Hill, of
Stourbridge, of having committed wilful perjury, by swearing that
he had not adopted certain royalty mines, while he had, in fact,
signed a document to do so.&nbsp; Mr. Campbell, for the defence,
urged that many a man signed deeds which he did not understand;
and a host of witnesses appeared to give Mr. Hill the best of
characters.&nbsp; He was honourably acquitted.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;At the County Epiphany Sessions six men were tried
for destroying a thrashing machine, the property of Joseph
Fretwell, of Blockley, and were indicted for a riot and
assault.&nbsp; Mr. Godson and Mr. Lea were for the prosecution,
and Mr. Strutt and Mr. Evans for the defence.&nbsp; There was no
attempt to deny that the men did come into Mr. Fretwell&rsquo;s
barn, and take the machine to pieces; but on cross-examination of
the prosecutor it was shown that he was just about to quit the
farm, which he held under Lord Northwick, and that these men had
come to take the machine down by his lordship&rsquo;s orders, in
order to prevent the destruction of the premises by the lawless
mob who were going about the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Fretwell was
evidently regarding his landlord with feelings of exasperation,
because he had let the farm over his head.&nbsp; One of the men
was found guilty of riot and assault, the other five of riot
only.&nbsp; Two of them were ordered to pay a fine of &pound;30
each, and the others of &pound;20 each, and to be imprisoned till
those fines were paid.&nbsp; But the money was immediately handed
to them, and they were discharged from the dock.</p>
<p>Six men were charged with being concerned in the destruction
of Mr. Baylis&rsquo;s needle presses and stamps, at Tardebigg,
and were sentenced to twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment each.</p>
<p>Six other men were arraigned for going about the villages of
Defford, Pinvin, &amp;c., in a riotous manner, and obtaining
victuals and drink by threats and intimidation; but the evidence
only showed that they had importunately asked for relief at two
or three places, and inquired of a labourer in the road whether
his wheelbarrow was a &ldquo;machine,&rdquo; because, if it were,
they would smash it!&nbsp; They were all acquitted.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;Lent Assizes&mdash;The Rev. John Lynes, Rector of
Elmley Lovett, was sued for a penalty of &pound;270 for
non-residence in his parish for three months, under an act passed
in the year 1817, which provided that a clergyman absenting
himself for a quarter of a year <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>should forfeit a third of the annual
value of his living, and the living of Elmley Lovett was set down
at about &pound;800 a year.&nbsp; Mr. Jervis, with Mr. Richards
and Mr. Alexander, were for the prosecution, and Mr. Campbell for
defendant.&nbsp; A great number of witnesses were called to prove
the defendant&rsquo;s absence; some of them his own servants; but
in the opinion of the learned judge (Mr. Justice Taunton) the
absence for the entire time was not made out, and the jury
returned a verdict for defendant.</p>
<p>At the same Assizes was tried the action of <span
class="smcap">Shelton</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Steward</span>, rival surgeons at Bromyard, and
brought by the former against the latter for a libel, said to be
contained in a letter published in the <i>Hereford Times</i> and
<i>Worcester Journal</i>, and which was supposed to insinuate
that Mr. Shelton was ignorant in his profession, and guilty of
improper conduct.&nbsp; Verdict for plaintiff: damages,
&pound;10.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;At the County Epiphany Sessions, ten of the Dudley
colliers were indicted for a riot, to obtain a rise in wages, in
the previous December.&nbsp; Several parties, working in the
Broad Pit Collieries (Earl Dudley&rsquo;s) were ill-used by the
mob for working at the ordinary wages; but Mr. Godson, who was
for the prisoners, contended that their identity had not been
sufficiently made out.&nbsp; After four hours&rsquo; consultation
the jury acquitted all the prisoners.&nbsp; Seven of the same men
were charged with an assault on one of their butties at this
time, and five pleaded guilty by arrangement, and were liberated
on their own recognizances.&nbsp; The other two were acquitted in
the teeth of the evidence.&nbsp; Several other parties were
indicted for assaults arising out of these riots, but only two,
named Hill and Smart, were found guilty.&nbsp; Hill was sentenced
to six months&rsquo; and Smart to one month&rsquo;s
imprisonment.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, seven men were tried before
Mr. Justice Allan Park for being concerned in election riots at
Dudley, breaking windows, &amp;c., and were all found
guilty.&nbsp; They were sentenced to trifling terms of
imprisonment, excepting one man named Griffin, who had committed
a serious assault on Jewkes the constable, and, therefore, was
ordered to be imprisoned for twelve months.</p>
<p>Robert Osbaldeston was tried at these Assizes of shooting at
Mr. Wood, gunsmith, Broad Street, Worcester, and was acquitted
only on the ground of insanity.</p>
<p>Edmund Campbell Brewer, a confidential clerk in the employ of
the Stourbridge Canal Company, was found guilty of forging a bill
of exchange for some &pound;13 odd.&nbsp; He absconded to
America, and <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>then it was found that he had embezzled &pound;1,000
and more, belonging to the Company.&nbsp; Yet, upon the trial,
many witnesses gave him the best of characters; and the
prosecutors themselves said that his conduct had been most
exemplary till this time.&nbsp; Mr. Eberhardt followed him to
America, and apprehended him in Utica.&nbsp; He was sentenced to
be transported for life.&nbsp; Great exertions were made to
obtain a commutation of his punishment.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, before Mr. Justice Patteson,
was tried <span class="smcap">Hill</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Hickes</span>, an action brought by Mr. George
Price Hill, a solicitor in Worcester, against Mr. Hickes, for
having slandered him to his uncle at Dudley, by intimating that
he was a rogue, &amp;c.&nbsp; Verdict for plaintiff 40s.
damages.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Talfourd was for plaintiff, and Mr.
Sergeant Ludlow for defendant.</p>
<p>At these Assizes also was tried <span
class="smcap">Anderton</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Gibbs
and Ferney</span>, the latter being executors of Mr. John Moor, a
manufacturer of Dudley, and whose daughter Mrs. Anderton claimed
to be.&nbsp; The question was one of legitimacy, Mr. Moor&rsquo;s
wife having left him and formed a criminal intimacy with a Mr.
Corfield at the time of Mrs. Anderton&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; The
jury found a verdict for plaintiff, and property, to the amount
of &pound;6,000, thus passed into Mr. Anderton&rsquo;s
possession.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;At Warwick Lent Assizes was tried <span
class="smcap">Davies</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Badger</span>, an action brought by a journeyman
whitesmith of Dudley, against Mr. Badger a magistrate of Dudley,
for striking him with a stick at the Dudley booth, at the
previous East Worcester election.&nbsp; Mr. Balguy, K.C., was for
plaintiff, and Mr. Sergeant Goulburn for defendant.&nbsp; It was
of course made a political affair, and excited great
interest.&nbsp; Mr. Badger, through his counsel and his
witnesses, denied ever striking the man at all.&nbsp; The jury
returned a verdict for plaintiff: damages &pound;30, costs
40s.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes was tried <span
class="smcap">Parker and Son</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Robinson</span>, M.P., a case which excited much
attention at the time, and was particularly interesting to those
of the legal profession who looked to reap rich harvests at
elections.&nbsp; The plaintiffs sued Mr. Robinson for assistance
said to have been given him in the way of canvass, &amp;c., at
the election of 1832, when the sitting members were threatened
with an opposition by the Hon. Mr. Dundas.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson had
paid &pound;75, and paid &pound;13 into court, but the amount of
the bill was &pound;186.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson pleaded that he had
not given authority for such expenses to be incurred by
plaintiffs, who, at this election, were only subsidiary agents,
Mr. Cameron <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>being his chief attorney.&nbsp; Various solicitors were
examined pro and con to show that the charges were reasonable or
otherwise; and the Jury, eventually, returned a verdict for
plaintiffs, damages &pound;38; thus Mr. Robinson paid &pound;126
instead of &pound;186.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Ludlow was for
plaintiffs, and Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, M.P., for defendant; and
both made amusing speeches about the affair.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, before Mr. Justice Williams,
was tried <span class="smcap">Badger</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Cooke</span>, an action brought by Mr. Badger, the
Dudley magistrate, against Mr. Samuel Cooke, the celebrated
Radical mercer, for a libel.&nbsp; After Mr. Badger had been
found guilty of the assault on Davis at the Stourbridge election,
Cooke issued a placard triumphing in the result of that trial,
and saying that &ldquo;every honest man must ever afterwards look
with most indignant contempt on his (Mr. Badger&rsquo;s) actions,
since he had already disgraced the dignified functions of his
station,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The defendant addressed the
jury in his own defence, quoting papers to show that Mr. Badger
often made use of as strong expressions towards his political
opponents, and declaring that it was nothing more than a question
of Tory and Radical.&nbsp; He was found guilty, Mr. Justice
Williams declaring that the paper had a palpable tendency to
defame and degrade Mr. Badger in his character as a
magistrate.&nbsp; He was only required to enter into a
recognizance of &pound;50 to appear when called upon.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;At the Summer Assizes this year a very painful and
remarkable case of circumstantial evidence took place, being no
other than the trial of a wife and daughter for the murder of one
who had stood to them in the relation of husband and
father.&nbsp; On the evening of the 3rd of August, 1837, Mr. John
Orchard, the landlord of the Woolstaplers&rsquo; Arms Inn, in
Stourbridge, a man in the prime of life and in good health, was
seen to go up the yard attached to his house, and his wife and
eldest daughter, with a man named Smith, were seen to follow
him.&nbsp; He never returned alive.&nbsp; Smith came down the
yard again shortly, but the wife and daughter remained there some
time.&nbsp; Two or three hours afterwards the daughter told some
of the people in the house that her father was very ill, and she
was afraid he would die; but no one saw him until he was actually
dead.&nbsp; When a surgeon arrived the body was on a chair in the
kitchen, and Mrs. Orchard was supporting the head in her
hands.&nbsp; She pointed the surgeon&rsquo;s attention to a small
hole between the third and fourth ribs, immediately over the
heart, and said she supposed <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>it was done by a nail in tumbling
over some tubs in the yard.&nbsp; He had a shirt on, but there
was no hole in that.&nbsp; The brewhouse, tubs, and yard appeared
to have been just washed, and the opinion of the medical man was,
that Orchard must have been dead an hour at least when he saw
him.&nbsp; On a post mortem examination, the wound in question
was found to be four inches and a half deep, and went right
through the pericardium and right ventricle, so that it must have
caused almost instant death.&nbsp; Of course grave suspicion
under these circumstances could not but attach to the mother and
daughter, especially as there had been repeated quarrels between
them and the deceased, and the wife was also suspected to have
been improperly familiar with the man Smith.&nbsp; The
coroner&rsquo;s jury, however, returned a verdict of
&ldquo;wilful murder against some parties unknown,&rdquo; and
months passed without any further discovery.&nbsp; At last a
woman, who had assisted in laying out the corpse, told some party
that the man was murdered with a skewer, which was afterwards
thrown into the Stour.&nbsp; The woman, when interrogated by the
police, denied having said anything of the sort; but a
skewer&mdash;just such an instrument as would have produced the
wound&mdash;was found in the Stour, nevertheless.&nbsp; The wife
and daughter were then apprehended and put on their trial.&nbsp;
Mr. Whateley conducted the prosecution, and Mr. Godson the
defence.&nbsp; The judge, Lord Abinger, told the jury that they
must not convict the prisoners on suspicion, and they were both
acquitted.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;At the County Epiphany Sessions, William Baylis,
the crier of Evesham, appealed against the commitment of three
justices, who had ordered him to be sent to prison, under the
60th and 65th sections of the Municipal Act, for refusing to
deliver up the bell.&nbsp; It was denied that the court had a
right to entertain the appeal, but the court chose to do so, and
quashed the conviction, subject to a case to the Queen&rsquo;s
Bench on the points argued.&nbsp; A similar appeal was heard from
Robert Knight, one of the sergeants-at-mace under the old
corporation, who refused to deliver up his mantle.&nbsp; The
magistrates were&mdash;Mr. Strickland, Mr. Cheek, and Mr.
Ashwin.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes the Rev. T. B. G. Moore,
curate of Bromsgrove, prosecuted Mr. J. B. Crane, carrier, Mr.
Nicholas Hill, publican, Mr. W. Whitehouse, farmer, Samuel
Taylor, John Pinfield, jun., William Sansome, George Wakeman,
labourers, and Henry Hill, baker, for a riot alleged to have
taken place at a church <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>rate meeting at Bromsgrove; and
Nicholas Hill and Taylor were also charged with an assault on the
Rev. prosecutor.&nbsp; The meeting in question was held on the
14th of the previous February, and the parties who had got first
to the vestry had voted Mr. Greening to the chair and then
declared the meeting adjourned to the Town Hall; Mr. Moore, the
curate, however, declared that he was the only lawful chairman
and adjourned the meeting to the school-room.&nbsp; Here there
was a scene of great excitement, and after the meeting had
decided by a very large majority that there should be no rate, a
poll was demanded by the pro-rate party.&nbsp; Immediately upon
this there was a general rush to the platform&mdash;a violent
struggle for the vestry book&mdash;and all sorts of
people&mdash;Mr. Moore amongst the number&mdash;were tumbled
about, struck, and ill-treated.&nbsp; It was said that the riot
had been instigated by Mr. Nicholas Hill and Mr. Crane, and that
Mr. Hill, in getting the book out of the curate&rsquo;s
possession, had forced his head against the desk so as to cause
great pain.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Ludlow, in his speech for the
defence, made much of this being a case got up by
subscription&mdash;to crush the Bromsgrove opponents of church
rates, and to put money into the purse of Mr. Annesley, an
attorney, living twenty-five miles away from Bromsgrove.&nbsp;
Whitehouse and Sansome were acquitted; Mr. Nicholas Hill found
guilty of assault and riot, and the rest of the defendants of a
riot only.&nbsp; Counsel for plaintiff, Mr. Sergeant Talfourd and
Mr. Lea; attorney, Mr. Annesley of Pershore; for defendants, Mr.
Sergeant Ludlow and Mr. Godson; attorney, Mr. F. T. Elgie,
Worcester.&nbsp; In the following November defendants were called
up for judgment (after an unsuccessful effort to get a new
trial), when Nicholas Hill was sentenced to six weeks&rsquo;
imprisonment, and the other three to four weeks&rsquo;
imprisonment each.</p>
<p>At the same Assizes, Mr. Meredith, woolstapler, of Pershore,
was convicted of striking Lieutenant Amherst three times, one day
in the open street.&nbsp; There had been considerable excitement
in the town about the election of Guardians of the Poor for the
parish of St. Andrew, in the preceding March, and the plaintiff
and defendant were active men on opposite sides.&nbsp; The first
time they met in the street, Meredith put a paper into
plaintiff&rsquo;s face, saying, &ldquo;Look at that;&rdquo; and
when he put up his clenched fist to defend himself, Meredith
knocked his hat on one side.&nbsp; The second time Lieutenant
Amherst admitted that he had called Meredith a d&mdash;
blackguard, before any blow was struck, but Meredith afterwards
hit him several times.&nbsp; Meredith, having been found guilty,
was fined &pound;20, and bound <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>over himself in &pound;300, and two
sureties of &pound;100 each, to keep the peace for three
years.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;At the Michaelmas Sessions Samuel Cooke, the
celebrated Chartist draper at Dudley, was prosecuted for
attending and assisting at a riotous and illegal meeting at
Dudley, on the 16th of July.&nbsp; It was proved that a placard,
calling the meeting, had been seen in Cooke&rsquo;s window, and
that he himself addressed the assembly; but it did not appear
that he had said anything very outrageous.&nbsp; The meeting was
tumultuous, but no actual mischief had been done.&nbsp; Cooke
defended himself with a good deal of shrewdness, and complained
that he was a persecuted man.&nbsp; The jury returned a verdict
of guilty, and he was sentenced to six months&rsquo;
imprisonment, which was generally considered to be a very sharp
political visitation of his offence.&nbsp; William Smith Lindon
and James Hollis, for using seditious language at the same
meeting, were sentenced, the first to three months&rsquo;, and
the second to six weeks&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;In November this year, in the Queen&rsquo;s Bench,
a rule <i>nisi</i> for a criminal information, was granted
against the <i>Worcestershire Chronicle</i>, on the application
of W. H. Ricketts, Esq., for a libel in that paper imputing to
him jobbing and interested motives in disposing of the public
money to be laid out in building the Droitwich Police
Station.&nbsp; Upon the proprietors of the <i>Chronicle</i>
admitting that they had been misled and offering an apology, Mr.
Ricketts consented to the discharge of the rule.&nbsp; The
information on which the article complained of by Mr. Ricketts
was written, was supplied by Mr. George Ellins, a brother
magistrate; and as he refused to pay any of the costs which the
proprietors of the <i>Chronicle</i> had incurred, they inserted
another article, charging Mr. Ellins with having misled them in
the matter.&nbsp; This brought another rule <i>nisi</i> upon them
from Mr. Ellins, who affirmed that he did not volunteer the
statement to Mr. Arrowsmith, and had especially told him that
what he did say was not for publication.&nbsp; The argument
against the rule did not come on till November, when Mr. Sergeant
Talfourd showed cause for the <i>Chronicle</i>, and the Solicitor
General supported the rule on behalf of Mr. Ellins.&nbsp; Lord
Denman said it was absurd to suppose that Mr. Ellins gave the
information to Mr. Arrowsmith for any other purpose than that of
publication; and the rule was discharged with costs.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;At the Lent Assizes was tried <span
class="smcap">The Marquis of Anglesea</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Hatherton</span>, a cause more interesting
from the rank of the parties interested, and the right at stake,
than from any attractiveness <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>in the subject or the
evidence.&nbsp; It was an action to stop the noble defendant from
working coal mines on certain copyhold property belonging to the
latter at Cannock, in Staffordshire; and turned upon the question
whether Lord Anglesea, as lord of the manor of Cannock, had right
to the minerals.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Wilde, Sergeant Ludlow, Mr.
Alexander, and the Honourable Mr. Talbot, were retained for the
defendant; and the Solicitor-General (Sir William Follett), Mr.
Richards, Q.C., Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Whitmore, for the
plaintiff.&nbsp; A great number of witnesses were called on
either side, to prove rights and customs, and to perplex the
jury; and ultimately, after a trial of two days, a verdict was
found for the plaintiff, with nominal damages.&nbsp; The verdict
created much surprise.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 20&mdash;A Court of
Inquiry holden by Mr. Under Sheriff Gillam and a special jury, to
assess damages in the case <span class="smcap">Powell</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Perrins</span>.&nbsp; This was an
action to recover damages for the seduction of plaintiff&rsquo;s
daughter, plaintiff being a land surveyor at Hagley, and
defendant a chain maker, living near Stourbridge.&nbsp;
&pound;500 damages given for the plaintiff.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes a horrible case of
depravity was disclosed in the trial of Richard Taylor, a
blacksmith of Stourbridge, charged with shooting at his wife,
Hannah Taylor, with intent to murder her.&nbsp; Though she had
been the subject of a course of the most sickening brutality, she
refused to give evidence against him, and the witnesses,
therefore, were the neighbours and the prisoner&rsquo;s own
grown-up daughter, who stood in the witness box with a child in
her arms, which was the offspring of an incestuous intercourse
with her own father!&nbsp; The prisoner, on the particular
occasion for which he was tried, had shot at his wife, and beaten
her till she was well nigh killed.&nbsp; He then turned all his
children out of doors stark naked.&nbsp; He was only found guilty
of an assault, because nothing more could be proved without the
wife&rsquo;s evidence, and he was sentenced to six months&rsquo;
imprisonment only.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, Edwin Archer, a young labourer
from Rouse Lench, was tried for the wilful murder of George
Green, in the previous December.&nbsp; He pleaded guilty to the
crime of manslaughter, and was sentenced to fifteen years&rsquo;
transportation.&nbsp; The prisoner and deceased had been
quarrelling, and set about to wrestle; in the course of the
struggle, Archer drew a knife and stabbed Green in four distinct
places&mdash;one of the wounds penetrating the heart&mdash;and
death immediately ensued.&nbsp; As soon as the fatal deed was
done, Archer was aghast <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>with horror, and wept like a child
over the body of his passion&rsquo;s victim.</p>
<p>Samuel Bridgwater was tried at these Assizes, at the instance
of some very indefatigable Radicals, for bribery at the election
of 1841.&nbsp; The bill had repeatedly been thrown out by the
grand juries, as was supposed, on political grounds, until at
last a sufficient number of the right party were found to return
it as &ldquo;a true bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The case, however, now
broke down at its very commencement, because a tailor had been
sent to the Crown Office for copies of the return to the writ for
the Worcester election, and he had not had them compared with the
originals.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 1&mdash;The Rev.
William Smith, vicar of Overbury, obtained a rule <i>nisi</i> for
a criminal information against the <i>Worcestershire
Chronicle</i>.&nbsp; The parish had long been in a state of most
unseemly dissension, and the <i>Chronicle</i>, in giving a long
and very detailed statement of meetings and matters there, was
said to have libelled Mr. Smith in attributing conduct to him
which he disclaimed, and generally in reflecting on his character
and conduct.&nbsp; The rule was, however, afterwards discharged
by arrangement, and no further proceedings were taken.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;At the Midsummer Sessions, Sir Thomas Phillips,
Bart., and two of his labourers, were tried at these Sessions,
for assaulting George Cooper, a shoemaker of Broadway.&nbsp;
Cooper was collector of taxes, and went to Middle Hill to get a
balance of taxes from the honourable baronet.&nbsp; He had had
repeated disputes with Sir Thomas Phillips, and this was also a
disputed affair, so Sir Thomas ordered him off the premises; and
when he talked of levying a distress, Sir Thomas pushed him out
of the hall, and struck him with a garden paddle once or
twice.&nbsp; The two labourers were discharged, and Sir Thomas
Phillips fined &pound;10.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes, before Mr. Justice Maule,
was tried <span class="smcap">Lavender and Another</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Bucklee</span>, being an action to
recover &pound;3,500, which had been secured on a bond given by
Messrs. Thomas and William Bucklee to William Shaw, Esq., of
Britannia House, Worcester.&nbsp; It was said that Mr. Shaw,
shortly before his death, had cancelled the bond by cutting it
off.&nbsp; It was said by the executors that Mr. Shaw was not in
a state of mind to cancel the bond; and that his housekeeper, who
was a relation of the Bucklees, appeared to have great influence
with Mr. Shaw.&nbsp; A great deal of evidence was given as to the
transaction itself, at which interested parties were present and
took much part, and as to Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s state of health <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>at the
time.&nbsp; The jury, after an hour&rsquo;s deliberation, found a
verdict for the defendant.</p>
<p>A case which excited great interest in the city of Worcester,
was the trial of Charles Samuel Atkins, a young man respectably
connected, who was in the employ of Messrs. Griffiths and Clarke,
linen drapers, as a shopman.&nbsp; He was charged with embezzling
&pound;4, the property of his employers, on the 27th of
September, 1842.&nbsp; Atkins had been sent to Mrs. Jeremy with a
shawl and some satinette, and on his return said Mrs. Jeremy had
kept the shawl and not paid for it, and had retained the
satinette for approval.&nbsp; Mrs. Jeremy declared that she paid
the person who brought the shawl four sovereigns on the
spot.&nbsp; It was shown that in the very next week Mrs. Jeremy
had had some satinette sent her from Hill and Turley&rsquo;s, by
a young man remarkably like the prisoner, and that came to very
nearly the same sum as the shawl; and it was suggested that Mrs.
Jeremy might have confounded the two transactions.&nbsp; The jury
returned a verdict of &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; and the court
immediately echoed with deafening cheers, while Atkins fainted
away.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Talfourd conducted the prosecution,
while Mr. Bodkin, of the Old Bailey, was specially retained for
the defence.&nbsp; The linen drapers&rsquo; assistants of the
city afterwards presented Mr. Atkins with a silver snuff box.</p>
<p>Mary Francis, 24, single woman, was charged with attempting to
poison Mary Jeffs, an elderly woman, living at
Alderminster.&nbsp; The prisoner brought the old woman a cake,
pretending that some one had given it her to make a present of it
to the prosecutrix, but the strangeness of her manner in
delivering it, and her continually saying that she was only to
eat of it herself, excited the old woman&rsquo;s
suspicions.&nbsp; The cake was analysed, and was found to contain
a large quantity of arsenic.&nbsp; The prisoner was courted by
the old woman&rsquo;s son; but not the slightest motive could be
assigned for her wish to deprive the mother of life.&nbsp; She
was found guilty, and sentenced to fifteen years&rsquo;
transportation.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;At the Lent Assizes was tried the <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Smith</span>, being an action brought by William
Harris, the parish clerk of Overbury, against the Rev. William
Smith, the vicar, for dismissing him from his situation.&nbsp;
Mr. Smith alleged that the clerk had been guilty of drunkenness,
had read the responses irreverently, and had interrupted the
celebration of the sacrament on a particular occasion.&nbsp;
Harris denied the whole of these charges, and the present trial
was on a return to a mandamus in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Bench to
ascertain their truth.&nbsp; Various witnesses were examined on
both sides: those for Harris asserting that it was Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s eccentricities that alone caused the clerk to
err.&nbsp; The jury found that the charges of drunkenness were
proved, and that Harris had spoken the responses loudly to annoy
Mr. Smith, but that the charge of interrupting the sacrament was
not true.&nbsp; The court, thereupon, ordered the verdict to be
entered for defendant.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 23&mdash;At
Hereford Assizes was tried <span class="smcap">Bellers</span>
<i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Chalk and Holl</span>, being an
action for libel, said to be contained in a paragraph in the
<i>Worcester Herald</i> of the 2nd of December, 1843.&nbsp;
Colonel Bund, of Malvern, gave some information to the
proprietors of the <i>Herald</i>, on the strength of which they
inserted a paragraph charging Mr. Bellers, of Barnard&rsquo;s
Green, with cruelty to his mare, by shutting her up for years in
solitary confinement in such a position that she could not lie
down.&nbsp; Several statements afterwards appeared in the
<i>Herald</i> to the effect that the cruelty to the mare had been
abated after the publication of the paragraph, and reporting the
proceedings of a meeting, held at Gloucester, for establishing a
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.&nbsp; The Lord
Bishop of the Diocese presided at that meeting; and Mr. Thomas,
the secretary of the Society in London for Preventing Cruelty to
Animals, attended, and stated that he had personally inquired
into the alleged case of cruelty, and had found the statement in
the <i>Herald</i> to be correct.&nbsp; On the trial, Mr.
Whateley, Mr. Gray, and Mr. Godson were counsel for plaintiff;
Mr. Sergeant Talfourd and Mr. Valentine Lee for the
defendants.&nbsp; Acting on the advice of counsel, defendants had
not pleaded a justification.&nbsp; The publication of the libel
was admitted; of course, no evidence could be offered in
justification, and the jury found a verdict for plaintiff, as
they were bound to do under the circumstances: damages,
&pound;150.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes, John Bowen, a man of
about fifty years, formerly an officer in the navy, was tried on
the charge of defacing the parish registers of Croome
D&rsquo;Abitot, and sentenced to seven years&rsquo;
transportation.&nbsp; It was shown that Bowen was engaged in
making out a pedigree for a John Wood, who wanted to establish
himself as a relation to the celebrated James Wood, of
Gloucester, and had visited the Croome D&rsquo;Abitot rectory
several times for that purpose.&nbsp; While the curate was
looking in another direction he tore a leaf out of the
register.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Talfourd was for the prosecution,
and Mr. F. V. Lee for the defence.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span><span
class="smcap">The Queen</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Newton</span>, also tried at the Assizes, was a
charge against the eccentric barrister of that name, who used to
come the Oxford circuit, of having committed perjury, said to
have been committed in some affidavits.&nbsp; The presiding
judge, Mr. Sergeant Atcherley, stopped the case, as
insufficiently supported in the evidence.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;At the Michaelmas Quarter Sessions a singular trial
took place of two farmers, named Swan and Patrick, who were
charged with killing deer belonging to W. L. Childe, Esq., in
Kyre Parva park.&nbsp; The witness against them was a boy named
Passey, who said he saw the parties accused chase a fine buck
into one corner of the inclosure and then shoot it; but there
were some discrepancies in his testimony.&nbsp; Both these
farmers lived close to Mr. Child, and as the fences were not in
the best possible condition, the deer used frequently to get on
their land and eat their corn.&nbsp; Mr. Lee made an ingenious
speech for the defence, and called many witnesses to character;
after which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, amid the
applause of the court.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, eleven poachers were put on
their trial for the murder of Thomas Staite, one of the Earl of
Coventry&rsquo;s watchers, who was killed in a very desperate
affray which took place between the keepers and the prisoners on
the 19th of the previous December.&nbsp; One of them, however,
named George Lippett, was admitted as Queen&rsquo;s evidence; and
another, Francis Dingley, while in prison made a full confession
of the whole transaction.&nbsp; The keepers and watchers were
nine in number, and they encountered the party of poachers at the
gate leading into Park Farm, Pirton.&nbsp; A fight with bludgeons
took place, in which the keepers were altogether worsted, and one
or two of them left for dead.&nbsp; The poachers also fired off
two guns, but the shots did not take effect.&nbsp; The
unfortunate man, Staite, was found by his comrades, after the
affray was over, in a ditch close by the Park Farm house, so
badly used that he could not speak; and, indeed, he never uttered
a word from that hour.&nbsp; He was taken first to a neighbouring
cottage, and then to the Worcester Infirmary, where he died in
six days.&nbsp; The identity of all the prisoners, and the part
they had each taken in the affray, was very clearly made out by
the evidence of four of the watchers and the statement of the
approver Lippett.&nbsp; Mr. Godson, in a very able speech for the
prisoners, contended that the case was not made out by the
evidence of the keepers, and that Lippett was not to be believed;
ending with a protest against the game laws generally, as <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>the cause
of much injustice and innumerable crimes.&nbsp; The Lord Chief
Baron Pollock, before whom the case was tried, told the jury that
they might find the prisoners guilty of manslaughter; and, acting
upon this hint, the jury returned a general verdict against all
the prisoners of &ldquo;Guilty of manslaughter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Witnesses to character were then called on behalf of some of the
prisoners, and his lordship sentenced them to different terms of
transportation as they seemed to have taken an active part or
otherwise in the attack upon the keepers.&nbsp; Francis Dingley,
Samuel Turvey, Joseph Turvey, and Joseph Tandy were transported
for life; Thomas Hooper, William Broomfield, and John Cook
transported for ten years; George Brant for seven years; and
Thomas Cosnett and William Collins were sentenced to two
years&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; The prisoners were all Pershore
men, but the case excited the most intense interest in that part
of the county.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes, Richard Farley, cabinet
maker, fifty-three years of age, and Ann Jones, a married woman,
were tried for forging the will of William Welch, of Llandilion,
near Abergavenny.&nbsp; The will was first produced and attempted
to be used in Worcester&mdash;hence the trial took place
here.&nbsp; Farley was Welch&rsquo;s son-in-law, and the will
conveyed some property at Aston Ingham to him instead of to his
own son, William Welch.&nbsp; A number of witnesses declared that
the will was not in the handwriting of the deceased, and that one
at least of the signatures was written by the prisoner
himself.&nbsp; Ann Jones was an attesting witness, and repeatedly
asserted the genuineness of the will.&nbsp; Farley was sentenced
to fifteen years&rsquo; transportation, and Jones to twelve
months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;At the Lent Assizes this year, a trial took place
which excited considerable interest&mdash;that of <span
class="smcap">Harris</span> <i>v.</i> <span
class="smcap">Grissell</span>, being an action brought by Mr.
George Harris, carpet manufacturer, of Stourport, against
(really) the Severn Navigation Commissioners, though the
ostensible defendants were the contractors of the
works&mdash;Messrs. Grissell and Peto.&nbsp; Mr. Harris had a
mill on the Stour, and he said that owing to the erection of the
weir at Lincombe, the water in the Stour had been so pounded up
as frequently to stop his undershot wheels, and to render his
mill useless.&nbsp; A great number of witnesses were examined on
both sides, and the learned judge (Mr. Sergeant Gazelee) having
told the jury that there was no defence to the action, they
returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with &pound;500 damages;
but this extraordinary summing <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>up of the judge&rsquo;s enabled the
defendants to get a rule for a new trial, and the matter never
proceeded further.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;At the Midsummer Assizes, Harklas Lovell Blewitt, a
travelling tinker, was tried for the murder of his wife at
Dudley, on the 3rd of June.&nbsp; They were staying at a lodging
house, and the wife, to escape the ill-treatment of her brutal
spouse, hid herself in the coalhole; he followed her there with a
kettle of hot water, and, holding her down with one hand, poured
it over her head and shoulders.&nbsp; She was so dreadfully
scalded that she died in ten days; but though there was no
pretence for saying that it was unintentionally done, the jury,
to the amazement of the court, returned a verdict of
&ldquo;Guilty of manslaughter&rdquo; only, and the fellow was
sentenced to transportation for twenty years.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, four men, named Cartwright,
Sweatman, Payne, and Turberfield, were charged with breaking into
the toll house at Knighton-on-Teme, kept by an old man named John
Mound, and his wife, and stealing &pound;115.&nbsp; The burglars
used very violent threats towards the poor old people, who most
distinctly swore to all four of the men as the parties who robbed
and assailed them.&nbsp; They were consequently found guilty, and
sentenced to fifteen years&rsquo; transportation each.&nbsp; Yet
it was afterwards distinctly proved that Turberfield was not
engaged in the robbery, and he received a free pardon.&nbsp; Two
other men, convicted of burglary at these assizes, on what
appeared to be the clearest evidence, were discharged by the
Secretary of State, because it was afterwards proved, beyond
contradiction, that the crime had been committed by other
men.</p>
<h2>EXECUTIONS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> county has of late years been
almost wholly spared the painful spectacle of justice proceeding
to its direst extremity of taking away human life, though
formerly capital punishments were but too common, and inflicted
for what we should now esteem very inadequate causes of
offence.&nbsp; Their policy and propriety in any case are now
allowed to be fit matters for discussion; and it is probable that
public opinion may, in a few years hence, demand their entire
abolition.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>1800&mdash;At the Lent Assizes this year, ten persons
were sentenced to death, but seven of them were reprieved before
the judges left the town.&nbsp; Richard and John Lane,
brothel&rsquo;s, were convicted of the murder of Thomas Goode, of
Redmarley, in October, 1799.&nbsp; They were impatient to possess
some property which would be theirs at his death, and having
waylaid him, both shot him&mdash;one with a gun, the other with a
pistol.&nbsp; They were executed on the 10th of March, and each
died uttering execrations on the other.</p>
<p>1800&mdash;At the Summer Assizes, thirteen persons were
sentenced to death, and three of them executed&mdash;one for
burglary, and two for sheep stealing.&nbsp; They are said to have
died &ldquo;with the utmost resignation, and acknowledging the
justice of their sentences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1801&mdash;At the Lent Assizes, five persons were sentenced to
death for burglary, a woman for stealing two &pound;10 notes,
five men for highway robbery, three for horse stealing, one for
stealing a cow, another for stealing two calves, four for sheep
stealing, and two for escaping from prison after sentence of
transportation&mdash;twenty-two in all!&nbsp; Six of these were
left for execution; but great interest being made for some of
them, only one was actually hung.</p>
<p>1803&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span>&mdash;Richard
Colledge executed for horse stealing.</p>
<p>1803&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;Thomas Beach

Sanky, <i>alias</i> Young, convicted at the Assizes just
concluded of uttering a forged bill of exchange, with intent to
defraud Messrs. Knapp and Lee, glovers, of Worcester, was
executed on a temporary gallows erected in Salt Lane.&nbsp; He
addressed the spectators for a full half hour, acknowledging the
justice of his sentence, and expressing his confident hope of
pardon through the righteousness and atonement of our
Saviour.&nbsp; He had attempted, in the interval between his
sentence and condemnation, to escape from the gaol, but he now
declared that he never entertained any idea of doing the gaoler
or turnkey any personal injury.&nbsp; <i>He then gave out three
verses of a hymn</i>, <i>and was joined in singing them by many
of the persons who surrounded the fatal tree</i>; after this he
prayed aloud in a very solemn manner for himself and the
spectators.&nbsp; Several distressing mistakes were made by the
executioner, but the unhappy sufferer retained his composure
amidst all these blunders, and appeared to die with absolute
cheerfulness.&nbsp; This young man was evidently possessed of
considerable talents, but they had been miserably misapplied.</p>

<p>1806&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 19&mdash;John

Corfield sentenced to death for a burglary at the house of George
Jukes of Tenbury, was executed at the new drop erected over the
entrance to the County Gaol.&nbsp; He had conducted himself after
his trial in a very refractory manner, and could not be brought
to acknowledge the justice of his sentence.&nbsp; Shortly before
his execution he wrote an exceedingly sensible and properly
worded letter to his wife.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 19&mdash;John
Harris convicted of uttering forged Bank of England notes at
Bromsgrove, hung in front of the County Gaol.&nbsp; He died
&ldquo;sincerely penitent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 17&mdash;Robert
Hollick, convicted of robbing Thomas Gittins and Thomas Hawker on
the highway at Claines, and cruelly ill-treating the latter, was
this day executed.&nbsp; As he was being led out of his cell, his
mother, sister, wife, and child, came to see him, not having
visited him previously.&nbsp; The execution was delayed awhile to
grant them an interview&mdash;which, as may be supposed, was a
most distressing one.&nbsp; It did not, however, unnerve the
culprit, who died with great firmness, though fully admitting the
justice of his sentence.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 23&mdash;Thomas
Dyer, capitally convicted of horse stealing, was executed at the
County Gaol, but died protesting his entire innocence of the
crime laid to his charge.&nbsp; He left a paper <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>behind him,
stating the names of the parties from whom he bought the horses,
and the sums of money he had given for them; but it does not
appear that anybody thought it worth while to make further
inquiries about the matter.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 24&mdash;William
Mantle and William Bird were executed at the County Gaol; the
former convicted of stealing sheep, the property of Mr. Henry
Hyde of Little Kyre; and the latter of breaking into the house of
Mr. John Bird of Bromsgrove, and stealing wearing apparel,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The ropes were nearly extended to their full length
when tied round the unhappy culprits&rsquo; necks, so that
scarcely any fall took place, and they died in great agony,
especially Bird.&nbsp; Their remains were interred in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s churchyard.</p>
<p>1823&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 24&mdash;James
Davis and Joseph Rutter, two young men convicted at the Lent
Assizes&mdash;the former of horse stealing and the latter of
sheep stealing&mdash;were executed at the County Gaol.&nbsp;
Davis was a deserter from the army, and appeared to have stolen
from sheer want.&nbsp; Rutter&rsquo;s had been a long course of
crime.&nbsp; Davis began to address the crowd when brought upon
the scaffolding, warning them to avoid Sabbath breaking and
vicious practices; when Rutter said, impatiently, &ldquo;Come,
let&rsquo;s have no more of that;&rdquo; and they were
immediately hurried into eternity.&nbsp; He literally preferred
hanging to a homily.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 21&mdash;John
Hobday, a young man only twenty-one years of age, having been
convicted at the Midsummer Assizes of a burglary at the Bell Inn,
Kidderminster, and a savage assault upon the officers who
apprehended him at Birmingham, was executed at the County Gaol
this day.&nbsp; He was reported to be very penitent, and prepared
for death.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 11&mdash;Michael
Toll, convicted of the wilful murder of Ann Cook, a woman with
whom he lived, by knocking her into a pit at Oldswinford, was
executed this day in front of the County Gaol.&nbsp; His body was
given to the surgeons to anatomise, and afterwards exposed to
public gaze at the Infirmary.&nbsp; In his stomach were found a
number of pieces of blanket, which he had swallowed in order to
produce suffocation.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 30&mdash;Charles
Wall, convicted at the Summer Assizes of the murder of Sally
Chance, at Oldswinford, was executed in front of the County
Prison at six o&rsquo;clock p.m., the execution having been
deferred to that unusual hour in consequence of the election
taking place that day.&nbsp; His body was delivered to a surgeon
at Stourbridge, and afterwards exposed to view to great crowds
who came from all <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>the surrounding parts to see it.&nbsp; The party
murdered was a little girl, whose mother the prisoner was about
to marry, and he killed her by throwing her into a lime pit.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 13&mdash;Thomas
Turner, a lad only seventeen years of age, convicted at the same
Assizes of a rape upon Louisa Blissett, a child under ten years
of age, at New Wood, about three miles from Kidderminster, was
executed this day.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 25&mdash;Thomas
Slaughter, <i>a lad not eighteen years of age</i>, was executed
for setting fire to a large wheat rick, the property of Mrs.
Rebecca Tomlinson, of Elmley Lovett.&nbsp; The poor fellow was
wholly uneducated, and evidently of weak intellect.</p>
<p>1832&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 22&mdash;James and
Joseph Carter, two brothers, aged twenty and twenty-two
respectively, and condemned at the Lent Assizes for two cases of
highway robbery at night, with violence, in the neighbourhood of
Bewdley, this morning underwent the extreme penalty of the law in
front of the County Gaol.&nbsp; Both men met death with firmness,
but without bravado; and Joseph Carter addressed the populace
from the scaffolding, warning them to avoid Sabbath breaking,
drunkenness, and bad women.&nbsp; The crowd on this occasion
behaved with unusual decorum, and seem really to have been
impressed with a feeling of sadness at seeing two persons hurried
out of life so early.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 12&mdash;Robert
Lilly, convicted at the Lent Assizes of the murder of Jonathan
Wall, at Bromsgrove, was executed in front of the County
Gaol.&nbsp; Wall had interfered to prevent his ill-using his
wife, and Lilly stabbed him in the abdomen with a
clasp-knife.&nbsp; There was a large concourse of spectators at
the execution&mdash;principally females, but the culprit did not
address them, and he died without a struggle.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 23&mdash;William
Lightband, executed in front of the County Gaol for the murder of
Joseph Hawkins, shopkeeper, of Areley Kings, on the 8th
September, 1836.&nbsp; He was a carpenter, entirely without
education, and had pursued a sottish and irregular mode of
life.&nbsp; However, the instruction he received when in prison
seemed to have had effect upon his mind, and he met death in
becoming manner.&nbsp; Though it snowed during the whole morning
there was a great concourse of spectators, and the Rev. Mr. Dodd,
assistant minister at the Lady Huntingdon&rsquo;s Chapel,
afterwards addressed them.&nbsp; Their behaviour was more decent
than usual on such occasions.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 26&mdash;The last
execution which took place in Worcester <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>was that of
Robert Pulley, who was condemned to death for the barbarous
murder of a poor girl, named Mary Ann Staight, at Broughton, on
the 5th of December, 1843.&nbsp; The manners of the prisoner were
so brutish and careless as to induce a doubt in his sanity; and
at the expense of the High Sheriff, Mr. John Dent, counsel was
provided at his trial to defend him on this ground.&nbsp; It was
also made the plea for a memorial to the Home Secretary on his
behalf, which was signed by many benevolent persons, and by those
opposed to all capital punishments.&nbsp; His conduct after
trial, however, was such as to convince all who conversed with
him of his perfect rationality.&nbsp; He was lamentably ignorant;
but listened with much attention to the exhortations of the
ministers who visited him.&nbsp; He displayed great firmness in
his last moments.&nbsp; The execution took place at noon on the
roof of the County Gaol, in the presence of a large crowd of
spectators, who behaved with much propriety.</p>
<p>The excitement occasioned by this execution produced much
discussion as to the expediency of capital punishments.&nbsp; A
public meeting was held in the Guildhall, Worcester, by those who
wished their abolition, at which Mr. Charles Gilpin attended and
spoke.&nbsp; Mr. George Grove attempted to show that Scripture
contained a command which was conclusive on the subject, and
required us to shed the blood of the man who took away the life
of another; but a resolution, declaring capital punishments to be
opposed to the spirit of Christianity and inexpedient, was
carried almost unanimously.&nbsp; The Rev. W. H. Havergal and Dr.
Redford also preached upon the subject&mdash;the former in favour
of, and the latter against, death punishments.</p>

150</span>RAILWAYS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> County of Worcester has
hitherto been very poorly supplied with Railway
communication&mdash;a strange fatuity having attended the various
undertakings which have been projected for meeting its
necessities in this respect.&nbsp; Worcester itself was, indeed,
almost shut out from this advantage, now so indispensable to
prosperity, till the half century had closed; but a brighter day
appears now to be dawning upon us.</p>
<h3>BIRMINGHAM AND GLOUCESTER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the only railway which has
yet been completed in this county, and it was promoted chiefly by
parties living at the termini, who made it their only object to
carry it in as straight a line as possible from point to point,
with very little reference to the convenience of the towns by the
way.&nbsp; If the shareholders could have foreseen the disastrous
influence of such a policy upon their own funds, they would
certainly have taken a different course, even though they felt no
interest in the prosperity of the places which they so much
injured by passing at considerable distances.&nbsp; The scheme
was <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>first projected in 1834, and the directors obtained
their act on their first application to Parliament in 1836; the
line was opened from Cheltenham to Bromsgrove, in June, 1840, and
throughout the whole distance on the 17th of December in that
year.&nbsp; The share capital subscribed was &pound;1,142,125, to
which &pound;380,076 was afterwards added of money borrowed on
debentures, &amp;c.&nbsp; Though the line, except at the Lickey,
presented no engineering difficulties, and was cheaply
constructed, yet the rate of profit was very small; and in
October, 1842, the &pound;100 shares were quoted as low as
41.&nbsp; In January, 1845, it was amalgamated with the Bristol
and Gloucester Line; and in 1846, when the broad and narrow gauge
interests were each making such struggles for the ascendancy, the
Midland Company entered into an arrangement to lease the line for
999 years, paying 6 per cent. upon the capital.&nbsp; The Great
Western bid 5&frac12; per cent., but would go no higher.</p>
<p>This undertaking was first introduced to the notice of the
citizens of Worcester at a public meeting held on the 15th of
January, 1834.&nbsp; The Company were at this time about to
determine upon their route, and had two plans before
them&mdash;the one eventually adopted <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Cheltenham, and another that was to have come by way of
Stourbridge, Kidderminster, and Worcester; the former was marked
out by Mr. Brunel, the latter by a Mr. Wooddeson.&nbsp; In
consequence of this state of things some gentlemen had formed
themselves into a provisional committee with a line of their own,
and Messrs. Gwinnall and Hughes, the solicitors employed,
procured the calling of this meeting, in the Guildhall,
Worcester, with the Mayor, W. Dent, Esq., in the chair.&nbsp; The
committee laid their plans, in the rough, before the meeting, and
asked a vote of sanction and support from the meeting.&nbsp; Sir
Anthony Lechmere wanted no railways at all.&nbsp; Major Bund and
Mr. Gutch proposed a month&rsquo;s adjournment.&nbsp; But a
resolution to stand by the committee, and to approve of no
railway but one which came right through Worcester, was passed by
a large majority.&nbsp; The Grand Connection Railway project took
its rise from the suggestions of this committee.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>The
Birmingham and Gloucester Company making no attempt to obtain an
act in the session of 1835, the matter was not again discussed
till the 22nd October in that year, when a meeting was convened,
over which Mr. J. W. Lea, Mayor, presided.&nbsp; Some of the
provisional directors were present, and admitted that they
intended to carry the line through Spetchley.&nbsp; Mr. John Hyde
proposed that the directors should be requested to include a
branch to Worcester in their scheme.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint said the
main line ought to be brought, and could be brought, much nearer
Worcester; and if it were not so brought, the city of Worcester
ought to oppose the line by every means.&nbsp; A committee of
conference was appointed, and the meeting adjourned for a
week.&nbsp; It was then announced that the provisional directors
of the line had agreed to have a survey taken of a deviation line
from Abbott&rsquo;s Wood to Norton, as well as of a direct branch
to Spetchley, and lay them both before Parliament to choose
from.&nbsp; Several speeches were made to show that the whole
line had been contrived without any regard to the interests of
the city and county of Worcester; and on the motion of Mr.
Hooper, seconded by Mr. Deighton, it was resolved that no railway
should be sanctioned by the people of Worcester that did not
bring the main line within a mile of the city.&nbsp; On the 4th
November another meeting was called, to consider the propriety of
surveying a line for a railway on the western side of the Severn,
to go by Kidderminster.&nbsp; It was evident that the Birmingham
and Gloucester directors intended to adhere to their original
plan, and so the citizens of Worcester determined to oppose them
vigorously, and entered into a subscription, headed by fifty
guineas from the corporate body, to survey a fresh line.</p>
<p>On the 31st March, 1836, a public meeting was called to
consider the expediency of further opposing the Birmingham and
Gloucester Railway Company.&nbsp; The directors of that company
had bound themselves in a penalty of &pound;70,000 to make a
branch to Worcester, to join there the Grand Connection Railway
to Wolverhampton, and on that score the opposition to their bill,
on the part of the citizens of Worcester, had been withdrawn, and
it had passed through committee in the Commons.&nbsp; Mr. Waters,
who had been chiefly instrumental in calling the present meeting,
said that he thought Worcester ought to join Tewkesbury in
opposing the measure in the House of Lords.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint
said the sum subscribed after the former meeting had been totally
inadequate for the purpose of opposing the bill, and so they had
to make the best terms they could&mdash;which were, that the
Railway Company <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>should make a deviation line from Abbott&rsquo;s Wood
to Oddingley, or forfeit &pound;70,000.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint
represented this as altogether distinct and separate from the
Grand Connection Railway, although, he said, he would put the
bond on the fire that night if the opposition were determined
on.&nbsp; The Mayor asked him how he could do that if the bond
were given him on behalf of the city, and he replied that he had
been well advised upon the point.&nbsp; A great deal of personal
altercation took place, and hot party feeling introduced, but the
meeting ended by Mr. Pierpoint proposing the following
resolution: &ldquo;That in consequence of certain satisfactory
arrangements having been entered into between the Birmingham and
Gloucester Railway Company and the Grand Connection Railway
committee, the interests of this city have been so consulted that
this meeting think it unnecessary to interfere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Waters, in a few days afterwards, published a letter in answer to
&ldquo;A Grand Connection Shareholder,&rdquo; in which he
declared Mr. Pierpoint to have been proved, by this very letter
of his brother shareholder, to have deceived the whole body of
his fellow citizens; inasmuch as there was only an agreement
between the Birmingham and Gloucester Company and Grand
Connection Company to carry out the deviation line between them;
or if the Grand Connection Company did not obtain their act, then
the Birmingham and Gloucester line were to make a branch from
Worcester to Abbott&rsquo;s Wood.</p>
<p>In April, 1839, the Company attempting to get a bill&mdash;to
extend their rails to the Berkeley Canal at Gloucester, and to
raise more capital&mdash;through Parliament, they were opposed by
the Worcester Chamber of Commerce on the ground that they had not
fulfilled their engagements with the city of Worcester.&nbsp; The
bond which they had given to Mr. Pierpoint, as Chairman of the
Grand Connection Railway Company, binding them in a penalty of
&pound;70,000 to make a branch from Worcester to Abbott&rsquo;s
Wood, was, they said, null and void, because the Grand Connection
Railway Company had ceased to exist.&nbsp; The Parliamentary
committee, principally in consequence of the able and zealous
exertions of Mr. John Hill, the Town Clerk of Worcester,
determined that the Company should be compelled to introduce into
the bill clauses obliging them to complete the Abbott&rsquo;s
Wood branch before opening the main line for traffic.&nbsp; The
Birmingham and Gloucester Company, after this decision, gave up
their bill.</p>
<p>In 1842 the Company, having been threatened with proceedings
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>under
the bond, offered to construct a branch with a single line of
rails from Spetchley to Sansome Fields, Worcester.&nbsp; A public
meeting was called on the 15th of August, to consider this
proposal.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint and Mr. John Dent moved the
acceptance of the proposal.&nbsp; Mr. E. L. Williams and Mr.
Waters moved, as an amendment, that the city should abide by the
bond, and be satisfied with nothing less; and after a long
discussion the Mayor put the matter to the vote, and declared the
amendment carried.</p>
<p>In 1843 the Company brought two bills before
Parliament&mdash;the one a money bill, and the other to get
powers to make a branch from Bredicot to Worcester.&nbsp; The
latter was opposed in committee by Mr. Berkeley, of Spetchley, on
the ground of an agreement between him and the Company that such
a division of his lands should not be made.&nbsp; The other was
opposed by the Worcester Town Council and Chamber of Commerce,
with a view of getting justice done to the city; and they
procured the insertion of clauses binding the Company to abide by
an award of the Board of Trade in the matter.&nbsp; General
Pasley was accordingly sent down by the Board of Trade to survey
the county in September; and upon his report, and a hearing of
the several interests, they issued their award in the following
April.&nbsp; By this the Railway Company were called upon to make
a branch from Bredicot to the Bath Road, Worcester.&nbsp; But no
further steps were ever taken in the matter.&nbsp; Such a branch
as the one proposed would only have been in the way when the
Oxford and Wolverhampton line was constructed; and with that the
public mind was now occupied.&nbsp; As to &ldquo;the bond,&rdquo;
that is still a subject of profound mystery, and much perplexes
the good people of Worcester.</p>
<h3>THE GRAND CONNECTION RAILWAY PROJECT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of this project has been
already mentioned.</p>
<p>In December, 1835, a public meeting was held in Worcester,
over which the Mayor, J. W. Lea, Esq., presided; at which it was
fully determined to proceed with this Railway, which was to go
from Gloucester to Worcester, on the western side the river; to
cross the Severn at Worcester, thence direct to Kidderminster,
and afterwards to Birmingham in one direction and Wolverhampton
in another.&nbsp; <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>The capital was to consist of 800,000 shares of
&pound;50 each.&nbsp; The shares were taken up pretty freely, and
the bill was read a second time, and went into committee in
March, 1837.&nbsp; It was strenuously opposed there by the
Birmingham Canal Company, and by several landowners.&nbsp; The
preamble was, however, declared proved.&nbsp; The committee
divided on the point, and the numbers were&mdash;for, 15;
against, 14.&nbsp; General Lygon, the chairman of the committee,
was most indefatigable in promoting the undertaking.&nbsp; The
bill was thrown out on bringing up the report in the House of
Commons, by a majority of 165 to 88.&nbsp; The principal argument
used against it was that it would destroy the beauty of the
county of Worcester.&nbsp; Its defeat was principally owing to
the landowners.&nbsp; It was attempted to be revived in the
following year, but without success.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1840 the Railway Commissioners
were engaged in determining what would be the most desirable
route for a grand trunk line which should connect the metropolis
with the Welsh coast, so that the quickest possible communication
might be made with Ireland.&nbsp; One project was to carry a line
from Port Dynllaen, in Brecknockshire, to Didcot, on the Great
Western line; and in this the people of Worcester felt much
interested.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 17&mdash;A public
meeting was held in Worcester in favour of this line; and in the
absence of the Mayor, Mr. Chalk, who was in London to present the
address of congratulation from the town council to Her Majesty,
John Dent, Esq., was called to the chair.&nbsp; A report from the
Chamber of Commerce on the subject of the meeting was read by Mr.
Alderman Edward Evans, and it was resolved to procure
subscriptions in order to obtain another survey of the line of
country from the Royal Commissioners.&nbsp; A similar meeting was
held in the next week at Evesham.</p>
<p>The Chester and Holyhead route, though the longest by several
miles, was eventually preferred by the Commissioners, because
Holyhead was the better harbour and starting point for
vessels.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span><span
class="smcap">In</span> 1842 a branch railway was projected to
connect Evesham with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway at
Eckington, but it was strenuously opposed by the owners of lands
through which it must have passed, and was thereupon
abandoned.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> railway mania of 1845 of course
did not leave Worcestershire uninfected.&nbsp; No fewer than
twenty-seven schemes, having more or less reference to this
county, were advertised in the Worcester papers, with long
statements of imaginary advantages and abundance of
&ldquo;provisional directors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Welsh Midland;
Worcester, Tenbury, and Ludlow; Worcester, Warwick, and Rugby;
and Worcester, Hereford, Ross, and Gloucester, were those which
found most favour with the Worcester public.&nbsp; A great number
of meetings were held in reference to them all over the county,
and every scheme was enthusiastically received everywhere; it is
quite useless, however, to allude to them further, as, without a
single exception, they were utterly resultless, excepting in
abstracting money from the pockets of people who could ill afford
to lose it.&nbsp; The 30th November was at Worcester, as at all
other places, a day of great excitement&mdash;the promoters of
the various schemes which had just started into existence having,
before twelve o&rsquo;clock on that night (Sunday), to deposit
their plans and sections with the clerks of the peace.&nbsp;
Plans for no less than thirty-six railways were deposited at the
office of the Clerk of the Peace for this county, <a
name="citation156"></a><a href="#footnote156"
class="citation">[156]</a> and thirteen with the Clerk of the
Peace for the city.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>The
early part of the year 1846 was occupied with
&ldquo;amalgamations&rdquo; and &ldquo;arrangements;&rdquo; then
came the ordeal of standing orders, and very few survived
that.&nbsp; In some instances ingenious engineers had made rivers
run up-hill, and canals swim over bridges, instead of allowing
the bridges to bestride the canals; while in many cases the most
trivial error of misdescription or omission to serve a notice was
sufficient to extinguish a scheme of real utility.&nbsp; Then
ensued the panic and &ldquo;winding up&rdquo;&mdash;very few of
the scripholders ever obtaining any return out of their
deposits.&nbsp; Only six of all the projects connected with
Worcestershire received the sanction of the legislature, and only
three of the rest were resuscitated in the coming season; these
were the Shropshire Union (Shrewsbury to Worcester), the
Worcester and Hereford (Midland Company&rsquo;s project), and the
Worcester, Tenbury, and Ludlow.&nbsp; The last mentioned,
however, seemed only to have been continued for speculating
purposes, and was speedily withdrawn.&nbsp; The Worcester and
Hereford line was warmly supported by the citizens of Worcester
in a public meeting held in February, 1847, but it was thrown out
on standing orders; and the Shropshire Union was also
abandoned.</p>

158</span>OXFORD, WORCESTER, AND WOLVERHAMPTON.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first meeting at Worcester with
reference to railway communication between that city and the
metropolis, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Oxford, was as follows:</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 19&mdash;The Mayor
presided at a very respectable gathering of tradesmen of the city
in the Guildhall, and Mr. F. T. Elgie made a statement of the
proposal by the Great Western Company to construct what is now
known as the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway, and
requested the support of the citizens to the scheme.&nbsp; Mr. W.
S. P. Hughes said the Grand Connection Railway would answer all
the purposes of the city of Worcester, and that was to be brought
before Parliament again immediately, with every prospect of
success.&nbsp; A resolution in favour of the line proposed by Mr.
Elgie was, however, carried unanimously.&nbsp; The merits of the
two lines were discussed at a public meeting at Kidderminster, on
the 4th of April, at which Mr. Elgie and Mr. Hughes supported
their respective schemes, and the Oxford line had a majority in
the meeting of three to one.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 9&mdash;Another
railway meeting was held in the Guildhall this day, with the
Mayor in the chair, to support one or other of the schemes for
connecting Worcester with London.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie and Mr. Brunel
appeared for the Oxford line, and Mr. Taunton and Mr. Addison for
a line from Worcester through Evesham and Leamington, to join the
London and North Western Railway.&nbsp; This was to be only a
single line of rails.&nbsp; Mr. Brunel assured the meeting that
the Oxford line was supported by the Great Western, and that
&pound;1,000,000 would be sufficient for its construction.&nbsp;
Mr. Hughes, on behalf of the promoters of the Grand Connection
Railway, said the cost of the line from Worcester to
Wolverhampton alone would be above a million; and proposed, as an
amendment, that it would be premature to express an opinion in
favour of any particular line till they had more details before
them.&nbsp; The meeting, however, almost unanimously expressed
itself in favour of the Great Western project.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;The great town&rsquo;s meeting at which the Great
Western and London and Birmingham projects for a Worcester
Railway were brought into competition for the approbation of the
citizens, was held in the Guildhall on the 4th November, William
Lewis, Esq., Mayor, <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>presiding.&nbsp; It was first
assembled in the Crown Court, but afterwards there was an
adjournment to the outer hall.&nbsp; The proceedings were
commenced by Mr. Waters&rsquo;s moving &ldquo;That until the
Parliamentary plans were deposited, the citizens were in no
position to decide upon the eligibility of the schemes proposed
to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. J. W. Lea seconded this
proposition.&nbsp; Mr. Leader Williams denied that the Great
Western were <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> in their scheme, and until
the plans were deposited they could have no security that they
would go on with it.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie retorted that Messrs. Waters
and Williams wanted no railway at all.&nbsp; The motion was
negatived by a very large majority.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Matthews,
Mr. Francis Rufford, and Mr. Barlow spoke on behalf of the
Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton line, which again received
the almost unanimous adhesion of the citizens, Mr. E. Shelton, of
Thorngrove, alone putting in a word for the London and Birmingham
Company&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 4&mdash;The
Railway Commissioners of the Board of Trade reported in favour of
the Tring line, and against the Oxford, Worcester, and
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 22&mdash;A
general meeting of the Oxford and Worcester Railway
Company&rsquo;s shareholders was held in the Guildhall,
Worcester, at which they determined to proceed vigorously with
their own measure, in spite of the unfavourable report of the
Board of Trade.&nbsp; The report of the provisional committee,
read at this meeting, stated that the project had been set on
foot in the previous February, by the influential mining and
commercial interests of South Staffordshire, who afterwards
applied to the Great Western Railway Company to support and lease
a line from Wolverhampton to Banbury; but this was ultimately
changed for the line to Oxford.</p>
<p>On the 26th of March a common hall was convened at Worcester,
at which the citizens unanimously agreed to petition in favour of
the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton line.&nbsp; A series of
resolutions in favour of the Tring line was transmitted to the
Mayor, who presided, as having been agreed to at a private
meeting of its supporters at Messrs. Hyde and Tymbs&rsquo;
offices, with Mr. Francis Hooper in the chair, the day before;
and this was assigned as the reason for the non-attendance of the
friends of the London and Birmingham scheme.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 10&mdash;The
inhabitants of Droitwich assembled in public meeting on the
railway question, and on the motion of W. H. Ricketts, Esq.,

<p><span class="smcap">The Great Battle of the
Gauges</span>.&mdash;The Parliamentary Committee to whom had been
intrusted the duty of reporting on the various railways proposed
for this district, commenced their labours on the 5th of
May.&nbsp; The members of the committee were the Right Honourable
F. Shaw (Dublin University), chairman; Messrs. Bramston, Horne,
Drummond, Villiers, Stuart, and Lockhart.&nbsp; The lines brought
before them were:</p>
<h4>BROAD GAUGE.</h4>
<p>1&mdash;Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway.</p>
<p>2&mdash;Oxford and Rugby Railway.</p>
<h4>NARROW GAUGE.</h4>
<p>3&mdash;London, Worcester, and Rugby and Oxford Railway.</p>
<p>4&mdash;Birmingham and Gloucester Railway&mdash;Worcester
Branch and Deviation.</p>
<p>5&mdash;Birmingham and Gloucester Railway&mdash;Wolverhampton
Extension.</p>
<p>6&mdash;London, Worcester, and South Staffordshire
Railway&mdash;the Tring line.</p>
<p>7&mdash;Grand Junction&mdash;Dudley Branch, Shrewsbury and
Stafford, and Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>8&mdash;Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway.</p>
<p>All the great railway interests of the country thought
themselves interested in the decision of the committee, and
brought their forces to bear upon the battle; inasmuch as it was
supposed that it would decide to which of the gauges the
preference should be given in coming railway economics, and so be
of vital importance to the opponent systems and the great
companies connected with them.&nbsp; For months prior to this
contest the press had swarmed with pamphlets, some contending
that a greater power, speed, and safety could be attained upon
the broad gauge; others requiring a uniformity of gauge
throughout the country, and pointing out the inconvenience of a
break of gauge at Gloucester and elsewhere: but the decision of
the committee had very little reference to any of these matters,
and was clearly influenced by different considerations.&nbsp; The
principal counsel employed were Mr. Talbot and Mr. Cockburn for
the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton line; Mr. Austin and
Sergeant Wrangham for the London, Worcester, and South
Staffordshire line; Mr. Daniell for the Birmingham and <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Gloucester;
and Mr. Kinglake for the Great Western Company: besides
innumerable others.&nbsp; Mr. Austin opened the case on behalf of
the London and Birmingham line to Tring, which he contended was
all that the district could require; that it would be absurd to
introduce the broad gauge north of Birmingham; and, lastly, the
Board of Trade had reported in its favour.&nbsp; The witnesses
connected with this county, who were examined in its favour, were
Mr. Richard Smith, mining agent to Lord Ward (whose interests had
been especially consulted in this scheme); Mr. William Hancock,
ironmaster, Cookley; Mr. W. Berrows, ironmaster, Dudley; Mr. E.
Williams, miller, Dudley; Mr. Best, Kidderminster; Mr. H.
Brinton, Kidderminster; Mr. Harris, carpet manufacturer,
Stourport; Mr. Heath and Mr. Griffiths, Bewdley; Mr. Lukin,
manager of the Weldon Tin Works; Mr. H. B. Tymbs, Mr. John Hood,
Mr. A. Wells, Mr. James Wall, and Mr. J. W. Lea, Worcester; Mr.
E. Smith, gardener, Evesham; &amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. Daniell then
opened the case for the Birmingham and Gloucester Company&rsquo;s
Deviation line, and examined Mr. M. Pierpoint, who said that he
believed this and the Tring line would be all that the citizens
of Worcester would want, and would answer their interests better
than the Oxford and Wolverhampton line.&nbsp; Mr. W. Chamberlain
and Mr. Robert Hardy, with Mr. Tombs, of Droitwich, were also
examined by Mr. Daniell.&nbsp; Mr. Cockburn then called witnesses
in favour of the Great Western Company&rsquo;s broad gauge
projects: those from this county were Mr. James Boydell, Oak Farm
Iron Works, Kingswinford; Mr. Jonathan Fardon, Stoke Works; Rev.
W. H. Cartwright, Dudley; Mr. Paul Matthews, Stourbridge; Mr.
John Hill, Mr. Alderman Edward Evans, Mr. William Lewis (Mayor),
Mr. Henry Webb, Mr. Leader Williams, of Worcester; and Mr. T. A.
Foster, of Evesham.&nbsp; After the committee had sat twenty
days, they reported that they found the preamble of the Oxford,
Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway and of the Oxford and Rugby
lines, proved: and those of the railways promoted by the London
and Birmingham not proved, with the Birmingham and Gloucester
Deviation line.&nbsp; They evidently came to this decision from a
belief that the broad gauge lines were so planned as best to
answer the wants of the districts through which they passed, and
that the public favour had been generally accorded them on that
ground.&nbsp; The avowed intention of the Great Western Company
to carry out a line to Port Dynllaen, had also probably some
influence with the committee.&nbsp; The greatest excitement
prevailed during the whole of the inquiry&mdash;no change of
ministry ever <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>created greater in the lobbies of the House&mdash;and
the result seemed to be very unexpected, as shares in the Tring
line went up considerably a day or two before the decision was
given.&nbsp; The committee were occupied some days longer in
considering the clauses of the Oxford Company&rsquo;s Bill, and
gave the Birmingham and Gloucester Company power to use the loop
line at Worcester, at a remuneration to be fixed by
umpires.&nbsp; It being known that the London and Birmingham
Company intended to oppose the Oxford Bill in the House,
petitions in favour of that line were sent up from Worcester,
Droitwich, Dudley, Blockley, and Chipping Camden.&nbsp; Lord
Ingestre moved that the report on the Oxford, Worcester, and
Wolverhampton Railway Bill be brought up.&nbsp; Mr. Pakington
seconded the motion.&nbsp; Mr. Cobden moved, as an amendment,
that an address be presented to Her Majesty to appoint a
commission to inquire into the comparative merits of the broad
and narrow gauges.&nbsp; Colonel Wood seconded the amendment;
which, after much debate, was lost by 247 to 113, and the Oxford
Railway Bill was read a second time.&nbsp; Its triumph was hailed
with great rejoicings in this county.&nbsp; The bill had a
comparatively easy passage through the House of Lords, though
strenuously opposed in committee by the London and Birmingham
Company, and on the 4th of August it received the royal
assent.&nbsp; Its various successes were occasions of excited
rejoicings in Worcester.</p>
<p>The first general meeting of the shareholders was held in
October, at the Guildhall, Worcester.&nbsp; The Yorkshire
shareholders sought to set aside the agreement between this
Company and the Great Western directors, by which the line was to
be leased to the Great Western Company for 3&frac12; per cent.,
and half the surplus profits.&nbsp; They wished to make this an
independent line; but at the representations of the chairman and
others, who, with a too fatal confidence in the Punic faith of
the Great Western, represented that they were under such
obligations to that Company in the starting of the project and
its success in Parliament, and that it would be dishonourable to
break this agreement of lease&mdash;the Yorkshire shareholders
withdrew their opposition to the reception of the
directors&rsquo; report.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 27&mdash;At the
first half yearly meeting of the shareholders, the chairman, Mr.
Rufford, expressed his gratification at the resolution of the
Great Western Company, to &ldquo;extend the guarantee to such sum
as shall appear to them necessary for the completion of the
second railway and works, and fixing the rate <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>of interest
at 4 per cent. per annum in lieu of 3&frac12; per cent. per
annum; subject to such conditions as may appear equitable between
the two Companies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The shareholders present seemed
pleased with this arrangement.&nbsp; The amount of expense
incurred before a sod of earth was turned, was &pound;76,124; of
which &pound;36,765 went in law and Parliamentary expenses, and
&pound;14,288 to the engineers.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 29&mdash;The
second half yearly meeting of the Oxford and Wolverhampton
Railway shareholders, held at Worcester, when it was promised
that the deviation line from Stoke to Abbott&rsquo;s Wood should
be opened in twelve months, and the whole line in three
years.&nbsp; Lord Redesdale called upon the directors to oppose
the making of the Oxford and Birmingham line upon the broad
gauge, foretelling that it would drain all the traffic from this
line.&nbsp; The meeting was harmonious, and thanks very cordially
voted to the directors.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 27&mdash;Half
yearly meeting of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton
Railway shareholders, at which Mr. Brunel reported that the loop
line from Stoke to Abbott&rsquo;s Wood might be finished by the
end of the year.&nbsp; Mr. Figgins, a London shareholder, wanted
to see the agreement with the Great Western, and to set it
aside.&nbsp; Mr. Barlow said there never was a lease more binding
and less likely to be set aside.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie produced a copy
of the agreement, by which it appeared that the line was leased
to the Great Western for a permanency; and the chairman said it
guaranteed four per cent. to the shareholders on whatever amount
might be expended.&nbsp; The resolutions prepared by the
directors were carried unanimously.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 24&mdash;At the
half yearly meeting it was announced that the interest, which had
hitherto been given to the shareholders on the amount of capital
paid up, must be discontinued for want of funds; and the
directors talked of making an arrangement with the Great Western
Railway Company &ldquo;more suitable to existing
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 9&mdash;At a
special meeting of the proprietors a long report was presented
from the directors, complaining that the Great Western Company
would now only give them &pound;4 per cent. on &pound;2,500,000
of capital, instead of on the whole sum necessary to complete the
line, as the directors had understood them to guarantee, and had
led their proprietary to believe.&nbsp; A committee of
proprietors was appointed to confer with the directors upon the
course to be adopted.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
1&mdash;Another special meeting of the directors, held in London,
at which the committee of proprietors, appointed at the previous
meeting, presented a report, severely impugning the conduct of
the directors in several particulars, and advised that the narrow
gauge alone should be laid down between Tipton and Abbott&rsquo;s
Wood, and the line immediately opened so far.</p>
<p>The year 1850 witnessed a total rupture with the Great Western
Company, and some very unpleasant meetings between the
shareholders and the directors.&nbsp; The Company passed two
bills through Parliament&mdash;the one authorising them to sell
the Stratford Canal to the Oxford and Birmingham Company, and the
other to enable certain other companies to advance them money for
the completion of their line.&nbsp; The first morsel of the
railway&mdash;the half of the loop line from Worcester to
Abbott&rsquo;s Wood&mdash;was opened on the 5th October, and
worked by the Midland Company under special agreement.</p>
<p>In January, 1851, Lord Ward became chairman of the Company,
and the whole management passed into different hands.&nbsp;
Messrs. Peto and Betts accepted contracts for constructing the
greater portion of the line; and arrangements were entered into,
by issuing preference shares at &pound;6 per cent., for raising
the capital necessary to complete the undertaking, which, it was
now estimated, would cost &pound;3,300,000 instead of the million
and a half, which was the sum originally intended to be
raised.</p>
<p>The preference shares were almost immediately subscribed for,
and the directors soon afterwards entered into an agreement to
lease the line to the London and North Western and Midland
Companies; whereupon Lord Ward resigned the chairmanship, and an
unpleasant correspondence took place between his lordship and Mr.
Peto.&nbsp; The arrangement, however, was never carried out, as
an injunction was obtained by the Great Western Railway Company
to prevent any other company doing that of which they themselves
evaded the performance.</p>
<p>Since that time the directors have been proceeding to lay down
the line upon the narrow gauge, and with the view of working it
independently of either of the great companies, nor have the
Great Western been able to hinder them further.&nbsp; The whole
of the loop line was opened on the 18th of February, 1852, and
thirty-six miles of the main line, from Evesham to Stourbridge,
on the 1st May, 1852.</p>

165</span>IMPROVEMENT OF THE RIVER SEVERN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the age of railways, the
advantages to a nation as well as to a district of having its
ports brought as far inland as possible, were so many and
apparent, that it can be no wonder the improvement of the
navigation of the Severn was contemplated at an early date.&nbsp;
It was projected in 1784, by Mr. William Jessop, an engineer of
some note at that day; and though the science of hydraulics was
then very little understood&mdash;as, indeed, it is even now <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a>&mdash;yet the nature of the bed of the
Severn and its very gentle fall, marked it out as a river easily
admitting of improvement, and not at all beyond the reach of the
means then known and practised.&nbsp; The plan proposed by Mr.
Jessop was, so far as can be gathered from the reports and
documents still in existence, a very fair and feasible one; he
proposed to convert it into a ship canal as far as Stourport, by
means of weirs.&nbsp; As to the details of the scheme, we have of
course no means of judging.&nbsp; It was, however, opposed most
strenuously by the landowners on either bank of the river, who
feared that the weirs would prove obstructions <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>to the
current, and increase the frequency and mischief of the floods
which often cover the lands near the banks.&nbsp; The project
was, therefore, at that time abandoned, nor was it ever formally
broached again till 1835, when Mr. Edward Leader Williams, an
ironmonger in Worcester, pressed the matter so strongly upon his
fellow citizens, and so clearly demonstrated, by models and plans
of his own devising, that it was perfectly possible to make the
river, as far as Worcester, navigable for ships drawing twelve
feet of water, that they at length awoke to the advantages which
would accrue to them by the improvement of this outlet to
&ldquo;the great highway of nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fears and
objections of some of the leading landowners having been
overcome, a company was started for the purpose of carrying out
the scheme.</p>
<p>The first public notice of the matter appeared in the
<i>Worcester Journal</i> of November 12, 1835, when a provisional
committee was announced, and the inhabitants of Worcester called
together to give their opinion upon the plan.&nbsp; This meeting
was held on the 30th November, when Mr. Jonathan Worthington was
called to the chair, and Mr. Bedford read the committee&rsquo;s
report, which proposed that a pound lock should be erected at
Gloucester, below the ship basin lock, from which a channel of
500 yards in length should be cut to pass Gloucester bridge, and
a weir erected near Over bridge.&nbsp; The Haw, Mythe, and Upton
bridges were to be passed by similar cuts, and the estimated cost
of the whole scheme was &pound;180,000; at which sum, it was
thought, a depth of twelve feet might be obtained all the way
from Gloucester to Worcester, and six feet thence to
Stourport.&nbsp; Mr. Leader Williams explained the details of his
plan.&nbsp; The Earl of Coventry declared that he should give it
his hearty support; and the objections raised by other landowners
were satisfactorily answered.&nbsp; The money required was to be
raised in &pound;20 shares, and the press and public of Worcester
were singularly unanimous and enthusiastic in favour of the
project.&nbsp; The formal prospectus of the company presently
appeared&mdash;Mr. Thomas Rhodes was announced as the chief, and
Mr. E. L. Williams the resident engineer.</p>
<p>At a very numerous meeting of the shareholders held in
October, 1836, over which Mr. J. W. Lea presided, Mr.
Rhodes&rsquo;s report was <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>read; and it was decided, by a very
large majority, that application should be made to Parliament to
sanction a scheme for increasing the depth of the river to twelve
feet.&nbsp; Some of the landowners proposed that the depth sought
should only be six feet six inches, but this suggestion met with
no support from the general body of subscribers.&nbsp; As soon as
the people of Gloucester found that the project was taken up thus
seriously, they entered into a systematic opposition, in which
the selfish motives that actuated them were at first sought to be
flimsily concealed, but were afterwards unblushingly avowed and
unscrupulously worked out.&nbsp; At the first meeting which they
convened upon the subject, it was pretended that the health of
the city of Gloucester would be endangered by a stagnation of the
river at the proposed lock; that the salmon fisheries would be
destroyed, and the lands on the banks overflowed: therefore they,
the citizens of Gloucester, felt bound to oppose the
scheme!&nbsp; Afterwards they distinctly declared that they would
fight it tooth and nail, because it would take part of their
trade further up the river.&nbsp; Many of the landowners, too,
could not be convinced but that any alteration of the river, if
it did not increase the floods, would at least impede the
drainage, and render their lands permanently cold and damp.&nbsp;
The Shropshire traders, and a majority of the Worcester and
Birmingham Canal Company, both of whom feared that the tolls
raised would interfere with their receipts, were also its
opponents; though, as regards the Canal Company, nothing could be
more shortsighted.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced into Parliament in the session of
1837, and was opposed on standing orders, but passed these
successfully.&nbsp; The most urgent efforts were then made by the
Gloucester interest to defeat the measure on the second reading,
and with but too much success.&nbsp; Captain Winnington moved the
second reading on the 12th of April, and Captain Berkeley moved
that it be read on that day six months; the principal argument he
made use of was, that it would <i>be imposing a tax on a free
river</i>!&nbsp; The bill was supported alike by the Government
and by the leader of the opposition, Sir Robert Peel; but the
private influence brought to bear by interested parties was not
to be outweighed by the arguments of statesmen, or enlarged
considerations of national benefit.&nbsp; The bill was thrown out
by a majority of 149 to 124.&nbsp; The Gloucester people were
characteristically grateful to their two city members for their
&ldquo;unwearied exertions&rdquo; in opposition to the bill.</p>
<p>The shareholders met again in September, 1837, and a very able
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>report
from the committee was laid before them, in which it was stated
that the whole plan had been laid before the most eminent
engineers of the day, and some trifling alterations in detail
agreed to; but they could not recommend the shareholders to seek
any less depth of water than twelve feet: and as steps had been
taken to conciliate the landowners, they thought another
application might be made to Parliament with every prospect of
success.&nbsp; &pound;15,000 had been received on the shares, but
on the call which had been made &pound;4,000 were still in
arrear.&nbsp; The expenses had amounted to &pound;11,700.&nbsp;
The shareholders almost unanimously agreed to form themselves
into a new Company for the further promotion of the undertaking,
and a provisional committee was named for that purpose.&nbsp;
This committee, however, were not able to raise sufficient
capital to proceed with the ship project, and they therefore
called another meeting of the subscribers to the old Company,
where Mr. Cubitt gave an explanation of a plan to increase the
depth of the river to six feet six inches up to Worcester, and to
six feet from Worcester to Stourport.&nbsp; This, he said, would
cost &pound;150,000.&nbsp; After discussion, this plan was
adopted; and the necessary number of shares having been taken,
preparation was again made for application to Parliament.&nbsp;
In order to get rid of every pretext for opposition from the
Gloucester interests, all thought of weirs and works near that
city was abandoned; and from Saxon&rsquo;s Lode downwards it was
proposed to deepen the river by dredging only.&nbsp; By way of
diversion, however, another scheme was started conjointly by the
Worcester and Birmingham Canal and Gloucester interests, which
was to procure a depth of five feet in the river between
Gloucester and Worcester, by means of two extraordinary moveable
weirs, to be inserted at Saxon&rsquo;s Lode and Wain Lode Hill;
and this, though seen to be totally impracticable and ridiculous,
was advocated in the Gloucester papers by way of rivalry to the
Severn Company&rsquo;s plan, which they continued to describe as
fraught with injustice, because it would deliver a free river
into the hands of a Joint Stock Company.&nbsp; The funds of the
Severn Navigation Company proved insufficient to carry the scheme
out in its integrity; therefore the improvement of the river,
from Worcester to Stourport, for the present was abandoned.&nbsp;
This alienated the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal
Company, and altogether the opposition again got up to the
measure was so strong, that after the bill had been introduced
into Parliament in the session of 1838, and the standing orders
passed, a deputation of the Worcester Company met the Gloucester
and Berkeley Canal <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Company proprietors, to see if some further concessions
could not be made which might get rid of the principal objections
to the scheme.&nbsp; The result of this interview was, that the
Gloucester and Berkeley Canal Company consented to support a
project for the improvement of the river under public
commissioners, instead of a Joint Stock Company; and the bill was
therefore withdrawn, with the view of introducing another, on the
principle thus suggested, in the next session.&nbsp; The
shareholders in the Company were called together in September,
and received the report of the committee, but there were no
assets to divide&mdash;the additional expenses (&pound;5,333) had
just swallowed up the deposits.&nbsp; The exertions of Mr. J. W.
Lea, the chairman of the Company, were acknowledged by a special
vote; and many gentlemen present declared their willingness to
further any future efforts which might be made, by all the means
in their power.&nbsp; The year 1839 was consumed in efforts to
induce the Government to take the matter up, as they had recently
done the navigation of the Shannon; but these, though zealously
backed by Sir Denis Le Marchant, Bart., then member for
Worcester, all proved fruitless.</p>
<p>In August, 1840, the shareholders of the Company were again
convened at Worcester, and another attempt resolved on to raise
funds to apply to Parliament for powers to obtain a six feet
depth of water and place the undertaking under the management of
a Commission.&nbsp; A further call of ten shillings per share was
accordingly made, but so few of the subscribers responded to it
that another meeting was held in the ensuing month, and the
Company dissolved itself&mdash;thus ending the attempts to
improve the Severn by private enterprise and speculation.</p>
<p>The gentlemen, however, who had so long and laboriously
exerted themselves to effect this great national improvement, did
not lose sight of the subject, and in a short time after the
dissolution of the old Company one of the most influential
meetings ever assembled in Worcester was convened to prosecute
the matter afresh.&nbsp; At this meeting, held on the 11th
October, 1840, the Right Hon. Lord Ward, who was called to the
chair, made his <i>deb&ucirc;t</i> in public life, and advocated
the cause of the Severn Navigation Improvement in a speech of
remarkable ability.&nbsp; Lord Hatherton, Mr. Blakemore, M.P.,
the members for the city of Worcester, and others took part in
the proceedings, and the result was that a large subscription was
entered into, to which Lord Ward contributed &pound;500, Mr.
Bailey &pound;300, Messrs. Dent &pound;300, for the purpose of
defraying the expenses of <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>another application to
Parliament.&nbsp; On this occasion the proposal was to place the
undertaking under a Commission, so that no private parties might
gain any benefit from it.&nbsp; No works were proposed at or near
Gloucester, yet the usual opposition was improvised in that city
and by the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company.&nbsp; The bill
now introduced was allowed to pass the second reading unopposed,
but on its going into committee an attempt was made to add the
Monmouthshire and Birmingham members to the committee, but this
was opposed by Government as a most inconvenient infringement of
the standing orders, and was defeated by 117 to 33.&nbsp; The
committee consisted, therefore, of what was called &ldquo;The
Worcestershire List,&rdquo; which included eleven members from
adjoining counties, as well as those for this county and its
boroughs, and six selected members.&nbsp; E. W. W. Pendarves,
Esq., was chosen chairman.</p>
<p>On the 30th April, 1841, the committee sat for the first time,
and then began a struggle which, in the Parliamentary annals of
private bills, had up to that time been quite
unprecedented.&nbsp; Twenty petitions were presented against the
bill, but for several of them nobody appeared in support, and the
opposition almost resolved itself into the Gloucestershire,
Shropshire, and Birmingham Canal interests, and the
landowners.&nbsp; Mr. Sergeant Merewether, Mr. Talbot, and Mr.
Craig were engaged as counsel for the bill, and Mr. Sergeant
Wrangham and Mr. Austin were the principal opposing
counsel.&nbsp; The first day was taken up by Mr. Sergeant
Merewether&rsquo;s opening speech.&nbsp; For eight days following
the promoters called evidence in support of the
preamble&mdash;their engineers especially being subjected to the
most searching cross-examinations by the opposition.&nbsp; On the
tenth day Mr. Talbot summed up the evidence for the promoters,
and Mr. Austin commenced his address for the Worcester and
Birmingham Canal Company, and the examination of his witnesses
occupied two days longer.&nbsp; On the thirteenth day Mr.
Sergeant Wrangham spoke for the Gloucester interest.&nbsp; Six
days more were taken up by other opponents and their witnesses;
and on the twentieth Mr. Sergeant Merewether replied, and the
committee, after a short consultation, unanimously
resolved&mdash;&ldquo;That the preamble of the bill is
proved.&rdquo;&nbsp; This great victory was not achieved,
however, without most material damage to the scheme; for in order
to meet the opposition of the landowners, which evidently had
great weight with the committee, the promoters had to abandon the
weir below Upton, and consent to dredge the river up to
Diglis.&nbsp; Weirs in large rivers of this kind had not been
much known, and it was thought that they <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>might
increase the floods.&nbsp; Mr. Walker, the engineer, too, was
very positive that the required depth might be obtained by
dredging, and the committee, therefore, determined that that
should have a trial&mdash;and a most unfortunate determination it
has proved.&nbsp; Some other important alterations took place in
the discussion of the clauses, the principal of which was the
exemption of the Shropshire trade from toll; though it could not
be denied that they would derive a benefit, like all other
traders, from the Improvement.&nbsp; A long discussion took place
upon the position of the lock at Diglis, which the Worcester and
Birmingham Canal Company wanted put above the mouth of their
canal; but to this the committee would not consent.&nbsp; The
Commission, after much debate, was constituted as follows: three
justices of the peace for the county of Worcester, three for the
county of Gloucester, four for the Worcester and four for the
Gloucester town councils, one for the council of the city of
Bristol, one for Droitwich, one for Tewkesbury, one for Wenlock,
one for Newport, one for the Upper and Lower Avon Navigation and
the council of Evesham, two for Stourport, two for the
Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Company, two for the
Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company, two for the Gloucester
and Berkeley Canal, one for the Herefordshire and Gloucester
Canal, and one for the Coombe Hill Navigation&mdash;thirty in
all. <a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a>&nbsp; The toll was fixed at sixpence
per ton from Gloucester to Worcester, and fourpence per ton from
Worcester to Stourport: this being what the promoters
proposed.&nbsp; Having by this time got near the end of the
session, the opponents of the measure sought to render all the
efforts of the committee nugatory by speaking against time; but
this was seen through and defeated by the members of the
committee meeting in the evening as well as in the morning, and
at last the bill was reported to the House.&nbsp; Mr. Waters, the
solicitor to the bill, was publicly thanked in the committee room
for the singular exertions by which he had carried the measure
through, in the teeth of such a determined opposition.&nbsp; The
Parliament being prorogued immediately <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>after the
bill was reported, it was obliged to stand over till the next
session.</p>
<p>In the interval there was some grumbling on the part of the
Gloucester corporation and the landowners at the large sums they
had to pay for the Parliamentary opposition, but the Worcester
and Birmingham Canal Company prepared to renew the fight.&nbsp;
It came before the committee again in March, 1842.&nbsp; Some
opposition was here offered on behalf of the Tewkesbury people,
but the committee would not suffer the question to be reopened;
and the only alterations made were those suggested and proposed
by the promoters themselves.&nbsp; On the bringing up of the
report, Mr. Muntz moved the recommittal of the bill on behalf of
the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company, who complained of the
lock at Diglis being placed below the mouth of their canal, and
of the unjust exemption of the Shropshire trade from toll.&nbsp;
Mr. Mark Phillips and Mr. R. Scott spoke on the same side; while
Mr. Pakington, the Honourable R. H. Clive, Mr. Labouchere, Sir C.
Douglas, Lord G. Somerset, Sir Thomas Wilde, Sir William Rae, and
Mr. Ormsby Gore spoke in favour of the bill passing at once: and
Mr. Muntz, seeing the strong feeling of the House, withdrew his
motion.&nbsp; There was some further opposition made in committee
in the Lords, and four days were consumed there; but the bill
passed without any material alteration; and the royal assent
being given to it on the 13th of May, 1842, it at length became
the law of the land.</p>
<p>The first step was taken under the act on the 7th of June,
1842, when the commissioners met, and T. C. Hornyold, Esq., was
elected chairman.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Waters was appointed
clerk.&nbsp; Mr. William Cubitt was appointed engineer-in-chief,
Mr. E. L. Williams retaining his office as resident engineer; and
advertisements were ordered to be inserted in the newspapers for
loans.&nbsp; The first stone of Lincombe weir was laid on the 5th
of August, 1843.</p>
<p>At several subsequent meetings of the Commission, the
Gloucester commissioners amused themselves by offering every
possible opposition to the speedy progress and completion of the
work; though they were, of course, appointed for the express
purpose of carrying it out.&nbsp; However, they were always
out-voted by those commissioners who felt their interest and
honour alike concerned in the duties assigned to them by
Parliament, and the trial weir at Lincombe was opened on December
23, 1843.&nbsp; Spite of the ratiocinations of adverse engineers,
and those ignoramuses who fancy they know everybody&rsquo;s
business better than their own, the weir was found to <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>stand the
current, floods, and frosts of the winter admirably, and the
barge was passed through the locks in three minutes.</p>
<p>The work now proceeded rapidly&mdash;the Staffordshire and
Worcestershire Canal Company having advanced the necessary funds,
and the contracts having been taken by Messrs. Grissell and Peto;
with the exception of one sad accident on the 5th of August,
1844, by which twelve of the workmen engaged at Diglis lost their
lives by the upsetting of the boat in which they were returning
from their work, they were completed without a single drawback or
mishap.&nbsp; The lock at Diglis was opened on the 9th October,
1844; and this part of the work was thus completed in fifteen
months, in the most able and satisfactory manner, within the
original estimate of its cost, &pound;140,000&mdash;a fact almost
unexampled in the construction of great national undertakings of
this kind.&nbsp; The dredging, however, between Diglis and
Gloucester, occupied a longer time than had been expected, and
proved a very costly business; but this, it must always be borne
in mind, formed no part of the promoters&rsquo; scheme, but was
forced upon them by the landowners, who objected to the erection
of any weirs below Diglis.</p>
<p>The completion of the locks and weirs was celebrated on the
25th of January, 1844, by a public dinner at the Guildhall,
Worcester, when a testimonial was presented to J. W. Lea, Esq.,
for the zeal he had always manifested in the improvement of the
river.&nbsp; J. S. Pakington, Esq., M.P., occupied the chair, and
Alderman Edward Evans was vice-president.&nbsp; Amongst the party
were Lord Hatherton, the Mayor of Worcester, T. C. Hornyold,
Esq., Captain Winnington, John Dent, Esq., William Cubitt, Esq.,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The testimonial, which consisted of a quantity of
silver plate, with Mr. Lea&rsquo;s crest engraved on each
article, was of course presented by the chairman.</p>
<p>At the close of 1846, Mr. Cubitt certified that a depth of six
feet of water had been obtained from Lincombe to Gloucester, and
the Commission consequently met on the 1st of January, 1847, and
ordered tolls to be levied at all the locks in the terms of the
Act of Parliament.&nbsp; Some opposition was offered, both by
Gloucester Commissioners and by traders on the river; but on Mr.
Cubitt&rsquo;s certificate the step of raising tolls was
obligatory on the Commission.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that at
the time of Mr. Cubitt making the certificate there was six feet
of water in the river, though every one saw that under the system
of dredging it would be impossible to maintain that depth in all
seasons of the year.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>At
the annual meeting of the Commission in September, 1847, the
traders complained that the depth of water in the river between
Worcester and Gloucester was not six feet, and expressed their
belief that it could not be secured without additional locks and
weirs.&nbsp; The committee of works reported to the same effect,
and declared the dredging a failure.&nbsp; A committee was,
therefore, appointed to consider the best means of completing the
improvement between Diglis and Gloucester.</p>
<p>This committee reported to a meeting of the Commission, held
on the 13th December, 1847, recommending that application should
be made to Parliament for powers to put a weir in at Tewkesbury,
and to raise a dam at Over bridge, near Gloucester, to divert the
water into the other channel and to scour out the silt
accumulating there.&nbsp; The meeting assumed a very unpleasant
character&mdash;such personal and improper remarks being made
that Sir John Pakington, at one time, left the chair, but was
induced to return.&nbsp; The opposing commissioners negatived
that part of the proposal which related to the dam at the Over
bridge by a majority of seven to four.&nbsp; Preparation was
therefore made to apply to Parliament for the Tewkesbury weir
alone; but Parliament had, at this time, taken it into their
heads that a &ldquo;preliminary inquiry&rdquo; ought to be made
on the spot into measures of this sort; and, accordingly, in
February, 1848, sent Mr. Cockburn Curtis, a young engineer, to
take evidence, and make a report to the Admiralty.&nbsp; At
Gloucester he took a show of hands as to whether the
Commissioners had kept faith with the public in imposing toll or
not!&nbsp; Mr. Curtis&rsquo;s report was in accordance with the
unfriendly influence then prevailing at the Admiralty, and he
recommended a scheme of his own instead of the Tewkesbury
weir&mdash;a scheme which few people, besides Mr. Curtis himself,
have ever been able to comprehend.</p>
<p>With this report in their hands, the interested opponents of
all improvement on the river waited on those members of
Parliament whom they could in any way influence, stole a march on
the promoters, and threw out the bill most unexpectedly on the
second reading by a majority of 104 to 91.&nbsp; This was on the
6th March, 1848.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the commissioners, held in October of the same
year, both parties mustered their forces, and divided, in the
first place, upon the question of who should be chairman, and 13
votes were given for Sir John Pakington and 11 for Mr.
Hyett.&nbsp; It was then proposed by Mr. Lea that an application
should be <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>again made to Parliament, similar to the one of the
preceding session.&nbsp; It was represented that the Commission
was in debt to the contractors, principally because of the great
expense incurred in useless dredging, and that more money must be
raised.&nbsp; After a very stormy debate the renewed application
was agreed to by the chairman&rsquo;s casting vote only, and so
also were other necessary resolutions.&nbsp; In minor matters the
opposition had a majority.</p>
<p>In February, 1849, the &ldquo;preliminary inquiry&rdquo; took
place into the merits of this measure.&nbsp; The surveyors
appointed by the Admiralty on this occasion being Captain Bethune
and Mr. Veitch, C.E.&nbsp; These gentlemen again reported
unfavourably of the scheme as proposed by the Commission,
professing themselves desirous of seeing the river so altered
below Gloucester as to bring the tide up to Worcester!&nbsp; It
was understood that the great fight would again take place on the
second reading, which came on on the 23rd April, 1849.&nbsp; The
Admiralty, Board of Trade, and Government generally, Sir Robert
Peel, &amp;c., supported the second reading; but the private
interests in opposition prevailed, and the bill was once more
thrown out; this time by a majority of 34&mdash;191 voting
against it, and 134 in its favour.</p>
<p>In the session of 1850 a select committee was appointed into
the working of these &ldquo;preliminary inquiries,&rdquo; and in
consequence of the evidence given by Mr. Edward Leader Williams
and others, proving that they only added to the expenses of
passing a bill, without performing one act of utility which might
not be better done by the inquiry before the committee of the
House, they were abolished, and Parliament returned to its old
practice in these matters.</p>
<p>Since that time the Commissioners have been resting on their
oars, feeling it useless to go to Parliament again if they had
the same opposition to encounter, and trusting that the Admiralty
might be induced to take up the improvement of the river, both
above and below Gloucester, as a project of great national
importance.&nbsp; They have, indeed, directed a survey of the
whole river to be made, and Mr. Walker has made a
&ldquo;hasty&rdquo; report thereon, in which he says as little as
possible as to the river above Gloucester, and makes
impracticable suggestions as to its improvement below.</p>
<p>The present condition of the river is an evil example of what
may be done when men fancy their own selfish pecuniary interests
will be promoted by impeding that which would be so manifest <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>an
advantage to the country at large, as the improvement of one of
its principal rivers, so as to make it navigable for sea-going
vessels to the furthest possible point inland.&nbsp; Some of
them, however, are gradually awaking to the truth that no public
interest can thus be sacrificed with impunity, and to discover
their own shortsightedness in the matter.&nbsp; The time is not
far distant when some of those who have hitherto been the
bitterest opponents of the improvement of the river Severn will
be found amongst its warmest supporters.</p>

177</span>WORCESTER TOWN COUNCIL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first charter of incorporation
was granted to the city of Worcester in 1261&mdash;45th Henry
III.&nbsp; The charter of James I, granted in 1622, was, with
slight interruptions, the rule by which the city was governed up
to the time of the Municipal Reform Act; and it must be said for
the old Corporation that they appear to have been in a great
measure free from the jobbery and malversation of funds which
characterised so many of these close self-elected bodies.&nbsp;
They had indeed a civic feast, for which &pound;150 was yearly
allowed, and kept a cellar of good wines; but these things were
quite in accordance with the spirit of the time&mdash;some fifty
years ago.&nbsp; John Wheeley Lea, Esq., was Mayor at the time of
the extinction of the old body; the Earl of Coventry Recorder;
Charles Sidebottom, Esq., Deputy-Recorder (a rather doubtful
office then recently revived) and Town Clerk; and Mr. Deighton,
Sheriff.&nbsp; Great efforts had been made to induce the
burgesses, in the election of the new body, to make a calm and
impartial choice of those persons who were really most fitted to
conduct the business of the city, without respect to their
political bias; but in the excited state of feeling which
prevailed at that time, this was found impossible; and indeed it
<a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>was
hardly to be expected that the Liberals, after such an entire
exclusion from office, should make terms with their
opponents&mdash;it was at last their turn to enjoy the honours
which the Tories had hitherto monopolised.&nbsp; The first
election took place on Saturday, December 27, 1835, when out of
thirty-six councillors, thirty-four chosen were
Reformers&mdash;the Conservatives only returning two in St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s Ward.</p>
<p>1835&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 30&mdash;The
new body met for the first time, and took the declarations
required by the act.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 1&mdash;First
meeting for business, when the following Aldermen were elected:
St. John&rsquo;s Ward, Mr. Joseph Hall; St. Nicholas&rsquo;s, Dr.
Hastings and Mr. Edward Evans; St. Peter&rsquo;s, Mr. George
Allies, Mr. William Corles, and Mr. Francis Gibb; Claines&rsquo;,
Mr. C. H. Hebb, Mr. Richard Evans, and Mr. Thomas Stephenson; All
Saints&rsquo;, Mr. John Bradley, Mr. John Howell, and Mr. F.
Williams.&nbsp; Mr. F. Williams declined the honour, and Mr.
Thomas Chalk was afterwards elected in his stead.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 2&mdash;Choice
of officers&mdash;Mr. C. H. Hebb elected Mayor; Mr. George
Allies, Sheriff; and Mr. C. Sidebottom, Town Clerk.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 14&mdash;The
Council assembled for the first time in the room which has ever
since been used for their meetings.&nbsp; A committee was
appointed to confer with Mr. Sidebottom about separating the
offices which he held, and giving up that of Town Clerk.&nbsp; A
finance committee was appointed to investigate the accounts of
the old body; and it was determined to dress up the Mayor in
robes of scarlet and purple.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 21&mdash;It was
agreed by a majority of 31 to 10 that Mr. Sidebottom should
continue to hold the office of Stipendiary Magistrate, Judge of
the Court of Pleas, and Town Clerk, at a salary of &pound;500 per
annum.&nbsp; Mr. Stinton, Mr. Curwood, and Mr. Whitmore,
barrister, were proposed for recommendation to the Secretary of
State to the office of Recorder.&nbsp; Mr. Stinton had the
majority of votes.&nbsp; Salary fixed at &pound;150 per annum,
but afterwards reduced to &pound;100.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 26&mdash;The
Council recommended twelve persons as magistrates to the
Secretary of State&mdash;The Mayor, Mr. Alderman R. Evans, R.
Temple, Esq., Mr. Alderman Hall, William Shaw, Esq., R. Berkeley,
Esq., William Saunders, Esq., John Dent, Esq., L. <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>Johnstone,
Esq., William Acton, Esq., G. Farley, Esq., and Captain
Thomas.&nbsp; Three of these gentlemen were Conservatives.&nbsp;
Mr. Farley and Mr. Johnstone having declined to serve, the names
of Mr. Lavender (Conservative) and Mr. Alderman Corles were
inserted in the list, but the Lord Chancellor only appointed the
first ten.&nbsp; The wine of the old corporation was ordered to
be sold, except fifty dozen to be applied in aid of sick
poor.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 18&mdash;Report
made by the committee appointed to investigate the accounts of
the old corporation.&nbsp; The balance sheet presented to the
Council by their predecessors showed credit a balance of
&pound;1,028, while the real fact was that the old corporation
was in debt &pound;1,170.&nbsp; &pound;200 of this sum had been
promised towards the improvements in front of All Saints&rsquo;
Church, payable only on condition of the inhabitants doing their
part within a certain number of years.&nbsp; The new Council
confirmed this grant on the same terms.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 24&mdash;First
quarterly meeting.&nbsp; A statement of the value of the city
property was laid before the Council; which, some being
calculated at twenty-five years&rsquo; purchase, and others at
fourteen years&rsquo;, was reckoned to be worth about
&pound;43,000.&nbsp; In mortgages and debts to the charities
there was owing by the corporation &pound;5,381.&nbsp; The gross
produce of the corporation wine was &pound;823, being an average
of nearly 64s. per dozen.&nbsp; The Council determined to
discontinue the practice of &ldquo;fetching the fair from St.
John&rsquo;s to Worcester,&rdquo; as a &ldquo;farce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 7&mdash;It was
announced by Mr. Sidebottom that he had been gazetted as police
magistrate of the city; and as the holding of that office was
deemed by Government inconsistent with the town clerkship (as had
been all along foreseen), he must give up the latter.&nbsp; In
answer to a question by Alderman Corles, he said he intended to
retain the assessorship to the Court of Pleas.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 21&mdash;Mr. John
Hill chosen Town Clerk in the room of Mr. Sidebottom.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 5&mdash;The Council
received a grant of a separate Quarter Sessions, as they had
prayed.&nbsp; The appointment of Mr. T. Waters as Clerk of the
Peace was confirmed, and Mr. J. B. Hyde was appointed City
Coroner.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 7&mdash;The
Attorney-General&rsquo;s opinion having been taken, it was
decided that Mr. Thomas Hughes had no claim for compensation for
loss of his situation as Vice-Chamberlain under the old
body.&nbsp; This was a subject which had been repeatedly before
the Council.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span>
6&mdash;Dinner given by the Town Council to the Mayor.&nbsp; Dr.
Hastings was in the chair, and proposed the health of Mr. Hebb in
flattering terms; describing him as a benevolent medical man, an
author of some celebrity&mdash;having translated the works of
some French pathologists at a time when there was little
communication with the continent&mdash;and the constant advocate
of the diffusion of useful knowledge.&nbsp; As their chief
magistrate he had laid them all under a great debt of
obligation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Bishop and Clergy of the
Diocese&rdquo; was responded to by the Rev. T. Pearson, and
&ldquo;The Dissenting Ministers&rdquo; by Dr. Redford; &ldquo;The
Members for the County&rdquo; was answered by Mr. Cookes, Captain
Winnington, and Mr. Holland; and Mr. Robinson answered for the
city members.&nbsp; Colonel Davis responded for the
&ldquo;Magistrates of the County,&rdquo; and was most
enthusiastically received.&nbsp; 306 sat down at table.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 9&mdash;The
Council, in entering on their second year of office,
re&euml;lected Mr. Hebb as Mayor, and chose Mr. Alderman Gibb as
Sheriff.&nbsp; There were scarcely any changes made in the body
at the election on the 1st of this month.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 11&mdash;The
Council agreed to the by-laws which have since, with little
alteration, been acted upon.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 10&mdash;Addresses
voted to the Queen Dowager (of condolence for her bereavement),
and to the Queen Regnant on her accession.&nbsp; The Mayor, Mr.
Sheriff Gibb, and Mr. Alderman Hall were ordered to present the
latter.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
election this year did not alter the position of parties at
all.&nbsp; A very warm vote of thanks was passed to Mr. Hebb for
his services as Mayor for two consecutive years, and Mr. George
Allies was elected in his stead.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Stephenson
was elected Sheriff.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 23&mdash;Mr.
Deighton presented a petition from 126 farmers, holding 25,000
acres of land, praying the council to provide them with a covered
corn market.&nbsp; Some gentlemen proposed that they should use
the Town Hall, but eventually a committee was appointed.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 27&mdash;The
Council petitioned Parliament for an alteration in the fees and
regulations in passing private bills.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 15&mdash;The
Council decided against Mr. Deighton&rsquo;s proposition to allow
a salary of fifty guineas to the Mayor, by a majority of 23 to
12.</p>
<p>1837&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 28&mdash;The
Council decided against Mr. Alderman Chalk&rsquo;s motion to
throw open their meetings to the public, by 24 to 6.</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span>
21&mdash;The Council refused to remove the Corn Market to Angel
Street, or to grant the petition of the agriculturists to sell
the old Sheep Market as a site for a new Corn Market.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 2&mdash;The Council
petitioned for the abolition of the apprenticeship system, on the
motion of Mr. Alderman Edward Evans.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
municipal election made no difference in the political
constitution of the Council.&nbsp; At the first meeting of the
renovated body, Mr. Alderman Richard Evans was elected Mayor, on
the proposition of Dr. Hastings and Mr. Alderman Hall; and Mr.
John Hall was chosen Sheriff.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Richard Evans
was the first Dissenter who ever held the office of chief
magistrate in Worcester.&nbsp; The Aldermen elected this year
were Mr. William Corles, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Chalk, Mr. Lilly, Mr.
Edward Evans, and Mr. Benjamin Stokes.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 20&mdash;Mr.
Padmore chosen Alderman in the room of Mr. Stokes, deceased.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 7&mdash;Mr. E.
L. Williams proposed that the Council, &ldquo;being deeply
impressed with a conviction of a thorough examination of the
existing Corn Laws,&rdquo; should petition Parliament for an
inquiry into their operation.&nbsp; He thought agriculture needed
some protection, though the present laws wanted alteration: if
gloves required protection, corn did.&nbsp; Alderman E. Evans
seconded his motion.&nbsp; Mr. W. Pugh proposed, as an amendment,
that the Council should petition for a total repeal.&nbsp;
Alderman Hastings said that a repeal of the Corn Laws would be
productive of immense evil; because if they reduced the revenues
of the rich, they took it out of their power to assist the poor;
and they would certainly rue the day if they agreed to a change
that would be so silly.&nbsp; No measure that the legislature
could adopt would prevent corn being occasionally dear, and its
dearness now arose from deficient production and regrating.&nbsp;
On a division there appeared</p>
<p>For total repeal: Aldermen Hall, Corles, Lilly, and Padmore;
Councillors F. Hall, Greening, Davis, Smith, Oates, J. Hall,
George, W. Pugh, Crane, W. Chamberlain, Southan, Dance, Lee,
Ledbrook, Groves, and Thompson&mdash;twenty.</p>
<p>For inquiry only: The Mayor; Aldermen E. Evans, Hastings, and
Palmer; Councillors Fawkes, Horne, Dent, Lea, Grainger, Lingham,
Summerfield, and Williams&mdash;twelve.</p>
<p>At this meeting the Council, in compliance with the order of
the Lords of the Treasury, awarded Mr. Thomas Hughes an annuity
of <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&pound;3. 6s. 8d., as compensation for the loss of his
office of clerk to the forty-eight, which he had held under the
old corporation.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes had claimed much larger
compensation as Deputy Chamberlain.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 24&mdash;An address
voted to the Queen, on the motion of Alderman Hebb, seconded by
Alderman Corles, thanking her for resisting the attempt to change
the ladies of her household, and, further, for having called back
the Whigs to her councils.&nbsp; The only dissentient was Mr.
Summerfield.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
elections still brought no diminution in the preponderance of the
Whig party.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Hastings was first elected Mayor,
but declined to serve; and having paid the usual fine of
&pound;50, required its disbursement on the score of his being an
alderman, and the Municipal Act did not say anything about their
being fineable.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Chalk was elected unanimously
in his stead.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">March and
April</span>&mdash;The Council determined to oppose the
Birmingham and Gloucester Railway Company&rsquo;s new bill in
Parliament; but afterwards Alderman Corles moved, and Alderman
Hebb seconded, a motion for the discontinuance of such
opposition, on the ground that the Council had no legal right to
pay the expenses out of the borough fund.&nbsp; Alderman Hastings
moved the confirmance of the Council&rsquo;s previous
resolutions; and this amendment to Alderman Corles&rsquo;s motion
was carried by 20 to 6.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 16&mdash;The
Council voted addresses to the Queen, the Prince, and the Duchess
of Kent, expressing their loyal joy at Her Majesty&rsquo;s escape
from the shot of the assassin, Oxford.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">March to July</span>&mdash;The
grant of &pound;200 for the improvements in front of All
Saints&rsquo; Church, made by the old corporation conditionally
on their being completed by November, 1839, and renewed by the
new body for five years longer, was repeatedly discussed.&nbsp;
Mr. Alderman Hebb held that it was an illegal grant, and ought to
be resumed; but the Council, on obtaining an undertaking from
Messrs. Lea, Leonard, and Williams for its repayment at the end
of the second term of five years if the alterations were not then
completed, suffered the money to remain in their hands.</p>
<p>1840&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 9&mdash;The
newly elected Council&mdash;consisting of almost the same parties
as in the previous year&mdash;elected C. A. Helm, Esq., as Mayor
for the succeeding twelve months.&nbsp; Mr. W. Lewis was also
proposed, and received 16 votes to 22 for Mr. Helm.&nbsp; Mr.
Alderman Edward Evans was chosen Sheriff.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 6&mdash;The council
unanimously petitioned for a revision <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of the import duties, on the motion
of Mr. Sheriff Evans, seconded by Mr. F. T. Elgie.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span> 29&mdash;A
special meeting of the body was held to memorialise the Queen on
the subject of the Corn Laws.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie moved the memorial,
which asserted that the Corn Laws were the principal causes of
the present distress of the country.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint moved an
amendment, declaring that the discussion of political subjects
was contrary to the spirit of the Municipal Act, and highly
inexpedient; and wound up by an assertion of a wholly political
character, viz., that the distress of the country had been
produced by the hasty and crude legislation of the Whigs.&nbsp;
The amendment was negatived by 26 to 5, the minority consisting
of Messrs. J. Dent, Anderson, Pierpoint, Bedford, and
Summerfield.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
Conservatives made great efforts in all the wards to get a
footing in the Council this year, but, except in St. Nicholas,
were wholly unsuccessful.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Edward Evans was
elected Mayor, and Mr. Alderman Lilly, Sheriff, by 23 votes,
while 12 were given for Mr. Elgie.&nbsp; Mr. Hebb retired from
the Council; and Messrs. R. Evans, J. Hall, W. Lewis, G. Allies,
C. A. Helm, and C. Hastings were elected aldermen in room of
those who retired.</p>
<p>1841&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 3&mdash;A
special meeting to protest against the recent appointment of
magistrates without consulting the Council.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman
Allies proposed a resolution, which declared that the six
individuals who had been appointed magistrates owed their
elevation to political partizanship and not to the esteem in
which they were held by their fellow citizens; protesting also
against the appointment because of its exclusiveness, and because
the Council had not been asked to recommend.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman
Padmore seconded the motion.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes moved, as an
amendment, &ldquo;That this meeting is unnecessary and uncalled
for;&rdquo; and this was seconded by Mr. Bedford, who said that
parish officers could not get justice from the present justices;
and denounced the appointment of Mr. Sidebottom to the
stipendiary magistrateship as a &ldquo;flagrant job,&rdquo; only
to make way for Mr. Hill.&nbsp; The motion was carried by 27 to
4, and a memorial prepared to be presented by Sir Thomas Wilde to
the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;A
committee appointed, on the motion of Mr. Elgie, to inquire into
the truth of Mr. Bedford&rsquo;s declaration, that the
appointment of Mr. Sidebottom as stipendiary magistrate was a
&ldquo;flagrant job,&rdquo; and they reported that it was
altogether &ldquo;untrue <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>and unfounded;&rdquo; inasmuch as
Mr. Sidebottom declared that his resignation of the office of
town clerk was voluntary.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 20&mdash;A special
meeting of the body was held to congratulate the promoters of the
Severn Navigation Improvement on the passing of the measure, and
to thank the noblemen and gentlemen by whose exertions its
success had been secured.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 12&mdash;The
Council refused to nominate Commissioners of Income Tax for
inquiring into the emoluments arising from public offices held in
the city, and the appointment, therefore, reverted to the
treasury or the commissioners for general purposes.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 26&mdash;A
special meeting held to consider the railway question.&nbsp; Mr.
Alderman Chalk proposed that it was desirable for the Council to
examine whether there was any agreement subsisting between the
city and Mr. Berkeley, such as should preclude the city from
consenting to the project, or going to Parliament for whatever
line they thought fit.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint seconded the
motion.&nbsp; Mr. Elgie proposed, as an amendment, that it be
referred to the railway committee to inquire whether any
engagement had been entered into by which the citizens were bound
in honour or equity from becoming parties to the Bredicot
branch.&nbsp; The Town Clerk gave it as his opinion that there
was no agreement in existence which bound the city in any
way.&nbsp; On a division, the amendment was carried by 15 to
13&mdash;the Mayor, Alderman Corles, and four other councillors
declining to vote.&nbsp; Mr. Chalk, Mr. Bedford, and others
protested against the amendment being declared carried, because
it had not obtained, as required by the sixty-ninth clause of the
Municipal Act, <i>a majority of those present</i>.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;Mr.
Alderman John Lilly unanimously elected Mayor, and Mr. Alderman
Lewis, Sheriff.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 2&mdash;The
Council determined to oppose the Birmingham and Gloucester
Railway Company in their application to Parliament for powers to
make the Bredicot branch, by a majority of 25 to 5.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 1&mdash;The Town
Clerk brought a bill of &pound;250 for the costs of the
unsuccessful opposition to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway
Money Bill.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Palmer moved that it be referred
to the Finance Committee; but it was resolved by 11 to 9 that the
bill, which was admitted on all hands to be very fair in its
charges, should be paid at once, together with &pound;17 due to
the Town Clerk on a former occasion.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span>&mdash;The
Guildhall having been illuminated on the <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>occasion of
the Queen Dowager&rsquo;s visit to the city, Mr. W. D. Lingham,
the City Chamberlain, brought in a bill of &pound;18. 7s. 6d. for
the expense, the payment of which was disputed with most pitiable
parsimony.&nbsp; The Council divided, and 19 voted for payment to
14 against it.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;There was
but little contest in the municipal election this year.&nbsp; Mr.
Alderman Lewis was elected Mayor; and Mr. L. Ledbrook, Sheriff,
by 21 votes to 19 given for Mr. Edward Wheeler.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 5&mdash;Upon
the motion of Mr. Hughes, seconded by Alderman Padmore, it was
decided that the meetings of the Council should be thrown open to
the public; but this was afterwards set aside.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 4&mdash;The
Council, on the motion of Mr. Bedford, determined only henceforth
to style themselves, &ldquo;The Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of
the City of Worcester,&rdquo; as their proper legal title.&nbsp;
A motion to give a salary to the Mayor was rejected by 19 to
10.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>&mdash;The
Council (and afterwards the Chamber of Commerce) pronounced in
favour of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway
project, in preference to any other of the schemes before the
city, by large majorities.</p>
<p>1844&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;There
were no contests in the wards this year, except at St.
John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. William Lewis was re&euml;lected Mayor
without opposition, and Mr. Lloyd was chosen Sheriff by 22 votes
to 12 given for Mr. Elgie.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 11&mdash;At a
special meeting called to assent to, or dissent from, the Tring
line promoted by the London and Birmingham Company, and which
would pass through part of the corporation property in the
Blockhouse, &amp;c., Mr. Alderman Chalk asked the Council to
abide by its former decision in favour of the Oxford line, and
dissent from the Tring scheme&mdash;and proposed a resolution to
that effect, which was seconded by Mr. Alderman R. Evans.&nbsp;
Mr. Wall and Mr. Hood moved that the Council do assent to the
Tring line; but this was negatived by 18 to 7, and Mr.
Chalk&rsquo;s resolution carried.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 27&mdash;The
Council again declared in favour of the Oxford and Wolverhampton
line.&nbsp; Mr. Knight moved, as an amendment to the resolution
proposed by Mr. Elgie, that the Council should petition in favour
of the Tring line; but this was lost by 19 to 8.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
elections this year brought two more <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Conservatives into the
council.&nbsp; E. J. Lloyd, Esq., was elected Mayor, and Mr. F.
T. Elgie, Sheriff.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 3&mdash;The
Council petitioned for a total and immediate repeal of the Corn
Laws by a majority of 17 to 9.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 14&mdash;William
Lewis, Esq., chosen Mayor for the remainder of the year, in the
room of Edward Lloyd, Esq., deceased.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 5&mdash;At this, a
quarterly meeting of the Council, Mr. Sheriff Elgie moved a
petition against the New Gas Company&rsquo;s Bill (which had been
approved, in public meeting, the week before), and Mr. Hood
seconded it.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Chalk objected to such a subject
being brought on without previous notice, and to a quarterly
meeting being taken advantage of for such a purpose.&nbsp; He
moved an amendment for the postponement of the question, which
was, however, lost by 16 to 5, and Mr. Elgie&rsquo;s petition
carried.&nbsp; A counter petition was afterwards presented from
fourteen other members of the body.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;F. T.
Elgie, Esq. was unanimously chosen Mayor by the new body, and Mr.
Edward Webb, Sheriff.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 16&mdash;Mr.
Arrowsmith moved that the Council should erect baths and
washhouses with as little delay as possible.&nbsp; Mr. Bedford
thanked Mr. Arrowsmith for bringing the matter forward, remarking
that hitherto his own efforts, for sanitary improvements, had all
failed for want of support.&nbsp; The motion was unanimously
carried, and a committee appointed to carry out the suggestion;
and this committee has been formally renewed from time to time,
yet five years have now elapsed and baths and washhouses in
Worcester seem further off than ever.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 24&mdash;A
memorial having been presented to the Council, from the
agriculturists, praying to have the Sheep Market leased to them,
in order that they might erect a Corn Exchange thereon, Mr.
Arrowsmith moved that no sufficient reason had been shown to the
Council to authorise them in making a change that would be so
injurious to a great number of the inhabitants of the city.&nbsp;
This was carried by 18 to 13.&nbsp; The Council also, by a
majority of 18 to 8, agreed to a petition in favour of Lord
Morpeth&rsquo;s Sanitary Bill.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
elections this year resulted in very little change.&nbsp; Edward
Webb, Esq. was chosen Mayor, and Mr. Padmore, Sheriff.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 5&mdash;The
Council granted a lease of the Wheat Sheaf <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Inn, Corn
Market, and other premises, to one of the Corn Exchange
Companies.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 2&mdash;The Council,
at a quarterly meeting, passed a resolution, approving of the
Mayor&rsquo;s efforts to bring about an arrangement between the
rival Corn Exchange Companies; and begging the agriculturists to
rest satisfied with the one in Angel Street.</p>
<p>They also petitioned in favour of Lord Morpeth&rsquo;s Health
of Towns Bill.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 11&mdash;At a
special meeting, called to consider the Corn Exchange question,
the Council, after a very warm debate on various propositions,
determined to take the opinion of Mr. Alexander as to their right
to regulate the Corn Market, to take toll on corn sold, and to
prevent the removal of the market from its ancient site.&nbsp;
The opinion only went to justify the corporation in taking toll
on corn pitched in bulk, and no further proceedings were taken in
the matter.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span>&mdash;The
Council, with only one dissentient, agreed that it was desirable
that the Public Health Act should be applied to Worcester; and
appointed a committee to make a representation to that effect to
the Central Board of Health.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;Mr.
Alderman Padmore was elected Mayor; and as he declined to give a
Sunday breakfast, go to the Cathedral, or wear a gown, he gave
&pound;100 to the city instead.&nbsp; This donation, having
afterwards been considerably increased, has found a permanent
shape in the handsome town clock which now ornaments the front of
the Market House.&nbsp; Mr. Goodwin was elected Sheriff.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 1&mdash;The
Council having previously determined to petition the Lord
Chancellor to appoint six new city magistrates, because some of
those named in the original commission were dead, and others did
not attend on the bench, this day proceeded to the selection of
names.&nbsp; Alderman Lewis had 29 votes; Alderman Chalk, 27; the
Mayor, 25; Alderman E. Evans, 25; J. W. Isaac, Esq., 22; Alderman
Webb, 20; Dr. James Nash, 14; William Stallard, Esq., 10; Mr.
Jabez Horne, 8; Alderman Helm, 3; Mr. Bedford, 1; and Alderman
Elgie, 1.&nbsp; The first six names were consequently transmitted
to the Lord Chancellor.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>&mdash;The
agitation respecting the carrying out the Health of Towns Act
this year, caused considerable change in the composition of the
municipal body; the only suitability sought in the new
councillors being their known determination to oppose the <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>measure.&nbsp; Their subsequent proceedings have had
reference almost entirely to the</p>
<h2>APPLICATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACT TO WORCESTER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> passing of the Public Health
Act in the session of 1848 was an epoch of our
civilisation.&nbsp; It was the recognition of a great social
want, and an attempt to remedy a great social evil, which had
silently grown up with the increase of our large towns, and
threatened to turn our prosperity and blessings into a
curse.&nbsp; The principle of the act received the cordial and
unanimous assent of all the great parties in the state; and
though numerous alterations were made in the measure during its
progress through the Lower House of Parliament, these were
entirely improvements amicably suggested and cordially adopted by
the ministry who introduced it.&nbsp; Those who determinedly
opposed some of its details were always left, upon a division, in
very small minorities.</p>
<p>The chief objection which has been raised against the measure,
by those who have conscientiously or interestedly resisted its
operation, has been to the constitution of a General Board of
Health in London, having some check over the doings of those
local bodies to whom the working out of the act has been
intrusted.&nbsp; This is denounced by the word
&ldquo;centralisation,&rdquo; but the Poor Law Board daily
exercises, without remark, a much more stringent authority over
Boards of Guardians, who are just as much representative bodies
as Town Councils, than any which is vested in the Board of
Health.&nbsp; In many places where the act has been applied, the
need of such a supervision as that of the Central Board has been
so strikingly evinced that Parliament will, probably, soon be
induced to place yet greater powers <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>of control in the hands of the
Board, and make the provisions of the act entirely compulsory
instead of optional.&nbsp; It might seem wise and well to leave
the unerring laws of health and disease to work out their own
results, in punishing those who neglect the necessary conditions
by which alone health can be maintained where men congregate
together; but as the epidemics engendered by such neglect cannot
be confined to those who are their responsible producers, the
legislature, on behalf of society at large, has the right to
interfere.</p>
<p>The application of the act to Worcester has been productive of
immediate results that are sufficiently curious; but its
importance, as regards the future welfare of the city, cannot be
overrated, and on that account, much more than for any present
turmoil, which, in &ldquo;the whirligig of time,&rdquo; will
subside and be forgotten, the subject claims a special notice
here.</p>
<p>Worcester, more than most English towns, needed the
application of such a measure to its internal economy.&nbsp; Its
fair exterior, and the outward cleanliness of its principal
streets, are but the deceitful masks of hidden
insalubrities.&nbsp; Surrounded by hills, which attract the
moisture and screen it from the healthful breezes that would
drive away miasma, its atmosphere is too constantly damp and
relaxing in summer, and in winter the fogs, rising from the
stream and the undrained soil, lie long upon its dwellings.&nbsp;
The river, which flows through it, fortunately keeps up a
constant current of air, but epidemics always follow the course
of rivers.&nbsp; Though apparently well situated for drainage,
the greater part of the city is ill-circumstanced in this
respect, for the southern and western half, at least, is built on
a cold marl, which retains the soakings of the surface as a
sponge.&nbsp; These are natural reasons which, it might be
supposed, would have suggested to <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>the inhabitants the most careful
attention to drainage and cleanliness; yet it is a fact, that
scarcely a street in the whole city is supplied with a sufficient
drain, and that it contains more open cesspits, prolific of
noisome smells and active disease, than any town of equal size in
the kingdom.</p>
<p>The merit of having drawn public attention, in this city, to
the paramount importance of Parliamentary interference to enforce
sanitary improvements belongs to Sir Charles Hastings, M.D.</p>
<p>At the city election in 1846, when Sir Denis Le Marchant
suddenly appeared as a candidate, Dr. Hastings, upon the
hustings, addressed the citizens, who were then gathered
together, and said he was anxious Sir Denis should have their
opinion on a matter of the greatest importance to every
individual amongst them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Amidst the great party
struggles,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, &ldquo;in the
legislature, the social improvement of the people had been too
much overlooked, and it was certain that the sanitary condition
of the great mass of the inhabitants of this kingdom was such as
reflected no credit upon its Government.&nbsp; He wished,
therefore, the citizens of Worcester to impress upon Sir Denis Le
Marchant the propriety of giving his best attention to this great
question, and of using his best endeavours to get it promoted by
the Government.&nbsp; He hoped that the measures which had been
under the attention of the legislature for the last six or seven
years would, at last, receive the consideration they
merited.&nbsp; All alike would be benefitted by the passing of
laws necessary for the protection of the public health, and which
would have also a great effect on public morals.&nbsp;
(Applause.)&nbsp; He trusted that was their opinion, and if it
was so he prayed them to hold up their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembly unanimously responded to the Doctor&rsquo;s
appeal; and Sir Denis declared himself the warm advocate of
sanitary measures.</p>
<p>Dr. Hastings afterwards addressed a letter to the Town Council
on the subject; and in seconding Mr. Ricardo&rsquo;s nomination,
in 1847, he again mentioned the matter, amidst the cheers of the
assembly, and pressed it upon the attention of each of the
candidates.</p>
<p>Mr. Austin, the secretary to the Health of Towns Association,
came down in the autumn of 1846 to make an inspection of the
city, and report upon the works and alterations necessary to be
undertaken <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>for the purpose of securing the greatest possible
amount of health and comfort to the inhabitants.&nbsp; Mr. Austin
presented his report to the City Commissioners in December, 1846,
and so able and informative was it deemed that it was ordered, on
the motion of Mr. Pierpoint, to be printed for general
circulation; and a sum of &pound;20 was afterwards voted him by
the same body.&nbsp; Mr. Austin estimated the gross cost of
drainage for the entire city, proper water supply to every house,
baths and washhouses, conversion of soil for agricultural
purposes, at &pound;74,000; he believed a revenue of
&pound;19,000 per annum might be derived from such works when
carried into full efficiency; the interest and expenses of
management he set down at &pound;11,650.&nbsp; Some parties,
unconnected with either of the two governing bodies in the city,
this year gave notice of their intention to apply to Parliament
for a &ldquo;City Improvement Act,&rdquo; in which powers would
be taken to carry out all those alterations which were felt to be
so necessary for the good ordering of the town; but this project
was soon abandoned, and the City Commissioners declared that, if
Parliament did not that year introduce a general act, they would
themselves apply for an extension of powers to enable them to
carry out needful sanitary improvements.</p>
<p>At a dinner given to Captain Candler, in February, 1847, Lord
Lyttelton strongly pressed upon the Mayor, and citizens of
Worcester generally, the desirability of at once carrying out the
suggestions of Mr. Austin&rsquo;s report in their integrity.</p>
<p>The Government having introduced the Public Health Act into
Parliament, in the spring of 1847, petitions in its favour were
forwarded from Worcester, one of which was signed by 700 of the
working classes.&nbsp; The principal difference between the
measure as introduced by the Whig and Conservative Governments
was, that the one proposed by the latter placed the
&ldquo;centralising&rdquo; power in the hands of the Home
Secretary, instead of the Central Board, and would have
constituted new local bodies for working out the act, instead of
placing it in the hands of the Town Councils, which the Whigs did
on principle.</p>
<p>The first public meeting held in Worcester was one convened by
the Mayor, Mr. Elgie, on the 19th of April, 1847, to consider the
measure proposed by Government.&nbsp; But the Commissioners met
in the morning, and determined on opposing the Government bill,
doubtless because it would altogether extinguish them; and as a
good deal of alarm had already been created in the town by the
large figures in Mr. Austin&rsquo;s report, there was a
considerable opposition <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>raised at the meeting.&nbsp; Dr.
Hastings and Mr. Orwin moved a resolution, declaring the
necessity which existed for sanitary measures; and this was
carried.&nbsp; Mr. Arrowsmith and Mr. J. W. Isaac moved a second,
approving of the Government measure; but Mr. R. M. Mence and Mr.
Francis Hooper moved an amendment, to the effect that the Health
of Towns Bill contained many unnecessary and mischievous
provisions.&nbsp; The cost and the centralisation were the topics
chiefly dwelt upon by the opponents of the measure.&nbsp; Mr.
Orwin spoke in favour of the bill, and Mr. Thomas Lucy and Mr.
Pierpoint against it; the latter producing a toy whose joints
were moved by a string, to illustrate what the Town Council would
be in the hands of the Central Board.&nbsp; The proceedings were
spun out to such an inordinate length, that the meeting had
almost dissolved itself, before the resolution and amendment were
put.&nbsp; The division was very close, but the Mayor decided
that the resolution in favour of the Government bill was
carried.&nbsp; A petition to Parliament in its favour was
afterwards proposed, but that was lost, and the resultless
meeting then broke up.</p>
<p>The same week the Council adopted a petition in favour of the
measure, by a majority of 18 to 8.</p>
<p>In May, a petition was presented from Worcester in favour of
the Public Health Act, signed by the Very Rev. the Dean, and most
of the Canons and parochial clergy.&nbsp; The medical men of the
city also, without a single exception, petitioned that it might
pass.</p>
<p>The bill was committed in June, by a majority of 191 to 50;
the only Worcestershire members who voted in the minority being
General Lygon and Mr. P. Borthwick.&nbsp; The bill was, however,
after all, with a multitude of others, in the annual
&ldquo;slaughter of the innocents;&rdquo; and then came the
general election.</p>
<p>In seconding Mr. Ricardo&rsquo;s nomination as a candidate for
Worcester, Dr. Hastings again mentioned sanitary matters, and
declared, amidst the cheers of the assembly, that he would not
give his vote for any man who would not pledge himself to support
a bill for the improvement of the public health.</p>
<p>In January, 1848, Mr. Thomas Beggs lectured in the Town Hall,
Worcester, on sanitary improvements; and on the following day a
public meeting was held, over which the Mayor, Mr. Edward Webb,
presided.&nbsp; The Rev. John Davis then moved a petition to the
legislature in favour of sanitary measures, which was carried
without dissent; and Mr. Ricardo, who was present, expressed the
pleasure he should feel in presenting it, and in supporting
Government <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>in any measure they might propose for the advancement
of the sanitary condition of the people.</p>
<p>In April, a town&rsquo;s meeting was called to consider the
Government measure, on a hostile requisition; and the Mayor being
indisposed, the friends of sanitary improvements took no
part.&nbsp; Mr. Summerfield was called to the chair; and on the
motion of Mr. Mence and Mr. Hooper, a petition was adopted in
opposition to the Health of Towns Bill, and ordered to be
forwarded to Mr. Urquahart, for presentation.</p>
<p>In May, the Town Council, with only one dissentient,
petitioned in favour of the measure; and a petition of similar
import was also very generally signed by the inhabitants of the
city.</p>
<p>The bill passed the House of Commons on the 20th of
June&mdash;the opposition, in their strongest division, having
only mustered fifty-four votes.&nbsp; It met in the House of
Lords with entire approbation; and every one of the amendments
made in committee there, were with a view to make its provisions
more stringent and &ldquo;centralising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 3rd of October, 1848, the Worcester Town Council, on
the motion of Mr. Alderman Elgie, came to a resolution,
&ldquo;That it is desirable forthwith to bring into operation
within the city the provisions of the Public Health
Act.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a numerous meeting there was only one
dissentient to this resolution.&nbsp; A committee of fifteen
members was then appointed to carry out the resolution.&nbsp;
They communicated the resolution of the Council to the Central
Board, and requested that an inspector might be sent down to
inquire into the propriety of applying the act to Worcester.</p>
<p>Mr. George T. Clark, Government Inspector, accordingly gave
notice in November, both by advertisement and handbills posted in
all parts of the city, that he should make the necessary
inquiries as to the sanitary condition of the city, and invited
all parties to give evidence before him.&nbsp; Mr. Clark sat for
the first time at the Guildhall, on the 4th of December, and was
very cordially received by the Mayor, Mr. Padmore, and a
considerable number of leading citizens and tradesmen, some of
whom have since taken a very active share of the opposition to
the working of the measure; but not one word of objection to the
application of the act to Worcester was ever uttered in Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark&rsquo;s report appeared in April, 1849, and the
conclusions to which the inspector arrived were, that the public
nuisances in Worcester were many and great&mdash;constantly
creating sickness, and increasing the mortality of the place;
that what was principally <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>wanted was a proper water supply,
surface paving and drainage; and that remedies for the evils
complained of might be applied for a rate of not more than one
penny a week per house.&nbsp; The cost of the necessary drainage
he estimated at &pound;20,315, and of the water supply at
&pound;21,750, while he set down the annual income derivable from
the water works at &pound;4,238.</p>
<p>Acting upon this report, the Central Board made a provisional
order for the application of the Public Health Act to Worcester;
being competent to do this, as to any place where the mortality
ranged above 23.0 in 1,000 per annum&mdash;and, according to the
Registrar General&rsquo;s report, the average mortality in
Worcester, for the seven years previous to the passing of the
Public Health Act, was 25.05 in 1,000.&nbsp; A bill to confirm
this provisional order was introduced into Parliament in July,
1849; and, passing without opposition, received the royal assent
in August.</p>
<p>Immediately after the application of the act to this city, all
sorts of absurd rumours were put into circulation as to the
expense it would occasion to the ratepayers; and the ignorance
and misinformation that appeared to prevail upon the subject,
would scarcely be credited if related.&nbsp; Ward meetings were
very generally held, at which memorials to the Council were
adopted, praying them not to carry out the act, or to postpone
its operation.&nbsp; And thus commenced an agitation, which,
being fostered by persons who had their own or party ends to
serve, long continued to disturb the peace of the city.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Council on the 7th of August, Alderman
Elgie moved that the Public Health Committee should report to the
next meeting as to what offices were necessary to be appointed,
and other steps requisite to be taken under the Health of Towns
Act.&nbsp; This was carried by a majority of 19 to 11.</p>
<p>At a subsequent meeting, the committee reported that the
officers required would be a clerk, treasurer, surveyor, and
medical officer of health.&nbsp; An amendment for delay was
rejected by 22 to 12, and the clerk and treasurer were at once
appointed.</p>
<p>In consequence of the determination thus evinced by the
Council to proceed vigorously with the practical application of
the measure, a public meeting was called by the parties hostile
to it.&nbsp; This was held on the 25th of September, 1849, and
presided over by the Mayor, Mr. Padmore.&nbsp; Mr. Summerfield
moved the adoption of a memorial to the Central Board, praying
that the act might not be applied to Worcester, because it was
denied that the mortality of <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the city exceeded 23 in 1,000; and
because a majority of the inhabitants were said to be
unfavourable to the introduction of the Public Health Act.&nbsp;
Alderman Thompson seconded the memorial.&nbsp; Alderman Edward
Webb proposed, as an amendment, &ldquo;That inasmuch as the act
is at present applied to the city, and considering the
unsatisfactory state of the dwellings of the poor, the
insufficient drainage, and bad supply of water, the memorial is
unnecessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alderman Elgie and Mr. Waters addressed
the meeting at great length on the general question, and pointed
out the absurdity of supposing that any memorial to a board in
London could stop the operation of an Act of Parliament.&nbsp;
Excepting Mr. James Wall, who made a few observations, no one
attempted to speak on the other side; but the amendment was lost,
and the memorial carried by a large majority.</p>
<p>The presentation of the memorial was intrusted to the Rev. R.
Sargeant and Mr. Lucy, but the Board declined to receive them as
a deputation in the absence of Mr. Clark.&nbsp; The Rev. R.
Sargeant, therefore, forwarded it with a letter, and the Board of
course returned for answer, that they had no power to stop
proceedings under an Act of Parliament; and further, that the act
had been legally applied to Worcester&mdash;as the Registrar
General had certified to them, under his own hand, that the
mortality was 25.05 in 1,000.</p>
<p>The appointment of surveyor was postponed by the Council till
after the municipal elections for 1849; but at the meeting of
November 16, further delay was resisted, and an amendment to that
effect was defeated by 26 votes to 12.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Leader
Williams was then chosen surveyor under the Public Health Act, by
23 votes to 8 given for the opposing candidate, Mr. Samuel
Purchas.&nbsp; The question of salary was postponed.</p>
<p>For some months Mr. Williams went on, under the directions of
the health committee, preparing his plans for the improved
drainage and water supply of the city.&nbsp; His report on the
drainage question was issued and printed in June, 1850, and met
with very general approval.&nbsp; Having been called before the
Council, at their meeting in August, and given explanations upon
some points, the Council in full meeting adopted the report with
only two dissentient voices.&nbsp; The report estimated the cost
for the entire drainage of the city at &pound;17,345.</p>
<p>The excitement amongst ratepayers was, however, kept up by a
question of the necessity of appointing a medical officer of
health; and so strong was the current of public opinion against
such an appointment, that the Council were compelled to abandon
all thoughts of making it.&nbsp; Dr. Malden and Dr. Hastings both
addressed letters <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>to the Council, declaring that, in their opinion, a
medical officer was needed for the proper carrying out of the
act.</p>
<p>The by-laws necessary under the Public Health Act for the
regulation of slaughter houses, lodging houses, &amp;c., were
another fruitful source of squabbles during 1850.&nbsp; On the
5th of March a code was agreed to in the Council, by a majority
of 15 to 7, which rendered it necessary that an &ldquo;officer of
health&rdquo; should have the superintendence of such places, and
to these the Secretary of State gave his assent.&nbsp; In July,
however, the anti-sanitary party having increased in boldness,
carried a new set of by-laws, by a majority of 18 to 16, in which
the words &ldquo;inspector of nuisances&rdquo; was everywhere
inserted instead of &ldquo;officer of health.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
then begged the Home Secretary to endorse their inconsistent
proceeding, but he refused to do so.&nbsp; The original by-laws
are, therefore, now law in the city of Worcester; but as there is
no &ldquo;officer of health,&rdquo; no use has been made of
them&mdash;they remain a dead letter.</p>
<p>On the 5th September, 1850, the anti-sanitary party had a
public meeting in the Guildhall, at which Mr. Toulmin Smith
attended and delivered an harangue against centralisation.&nbsp;
The meeting actually came to a resolution &ldquo;to resist the
application of the act in that city and elsewhere; and, if
possible, obtain its repeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the municipal elections for 1850, parties were returned to
the Council avowedly &ldquo;to put a stop to the working of the
act altogether;&rdquo; but the dignity of the Council and its
proceedings was not improved by this infusion of new blood.&nbsp;
Up to the present time not a single step has been taken towards
the practical application of the act in the city; but, instead of
that, the Council have been engaged in a dispute with the
surveyor, whom they refused properly to remunerate&mdash;and thus
they have involved the city in great expense to no sort of
purpose.&nbsp; The details of this affair it would be altogether
undesirable to resuscitate, and the more so, as the Central Board
have pronounced the Council to be entirely in the wrong; but
there is reason to hope that wiser and more enlightened views, on
a subject which involves the future prosperity of the city and
the health and life of its inhabitants, will soon prevail.</p>

197</span>WORCESTER INFIRMARY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> noble charity had its origin
in the philanthropy of the medical men of Worcester in the year
1745.&nbsp; It was first opened in a room in Silver Street, and
it was not for twenty years afterwards that the present hospital
was built, at an expense of upwards of &pound;6,000.&nbsp; It has
been enlarged at various periods since that time, and is now
capable of accommodating 100 in-patients.&nbsp; The funded
property of the institution exceeds &pound;27,000, and the annual
subscriptions amount to upwards of &pound;1,200.&nbsp; The
physicians and surgeons attached to the institution at the
beginning of the present century, were Dr. Johnstone, Dr. Seward,
and Dr. Mylne; Mr. Pennell Cole, Mr. Sandford, and Mr.
Carden.&nbsp; The following are minutes of the appointments which
have since taken place, and of the more important proceedings of
the governors:</p>
<p>1800&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span>
31&mdash;Election of physician in the room of Dr. Johnstone, who
resigned.&nbsp; There were three candidates, and the choice of
the subscribers fell on Dr. Skey, who had 127 votes; Dr. Philip
W. Wilson 108, and Dr. Barnett 73.</p>
<p>1800&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 27&mdash;At a
quarterly meeting of the governors, it was ordered that all
legacies and benefactions amounting to or exceeding &pound;50 be
funded.</p>
<p>1801&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 7&mdash;In
consequence of &ldquo;the distressed state of the Infirmary and
the dearness of every article of provision,&rdquo; the order
respecting the funding of &pound;50 legacies was suspended.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>1801&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span>
28&mdash;Dr. Barnett unanimously elected one of the physicians in
the room of Dr. Chambers, resigned.</p>
<p>1803&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 1&mdash;Dr.
Philip W. Wilson unanimously elected in the room of Dr. Skey,
resigned.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 30&mdash;It was
ordered that the property of the institution, then invested in
the Three per Cents., should be transferred to the Four per Cent.
Government Annuities.</p>
<p>1812&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 26&mdash;Ordered
that in future the secretaries of the Infirmary should give
security, by bond, to the amount of &pound;200, for the delivery
of all books and papers belonging to the Infirmary.&nbsp; This
was in consequence of the late secretary, Mr. Staples, having
refused to give up the books, and a dispute as to the balance due
from him.&nbsp; The funds being very low and inadequate to meet
the expenses, the Bishop of the Diocese requested the parochial
clergy to make collections in their respective churches on behalf
of the institution, by which means &pound;1,483 were added to the
funds.</p>
<p>1812&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 2&mdash;Mr.
Charles Hastings elected house surgeon in the room of Mr. Blower,
resigned.&nbsp; Mr. Hastings had a competitor in the person of
Mr. James Lewis; and the votes were&mdash;for Mr. Hastings, 132;
Mr. Lewis, 131.</p>
<p>1813&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 13&mdash;The
number of patients which each subscriber was allowed to recommend
was limited to one patient for every guinea subscribed.&nbsp; The
high price of provisions was alleged as the reason for this
step.</p>
<p>1814&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 30&mdash;Dr. G.
Woodyatt elected physician on the resignation of Dr. Barnett.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 30&mdash;The order,
limiting the number of patients, rescinded, and the subscribers
permitted to recommend two patients for each guinea subscribed,
as was the case previously.&nbsp; The medical officers were
requested to invite the rest of the faculty in Worcester to
witness all the more important operations.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>
6&mdash;Election of surgeon: the office being vacant by the
retirement of Mr. Pennel Cole, Lord Somers proposed Mr. Thomas
Stephenson, who was seconded by Lord Beauchamp; Mr. Josiah Palmer
proposed Mr. J. P. Sheppard, seconded by Mr. Watson, Stourport;
Hon. and Rev. W. Jenkinson proposed Mr. Dangerfield, seconded by
Dr. Cameron.&nbsp; The result of the ballot showed for Mr.
Stephenson, 335 votes; for Mr. Sheppard, 238; and for Mr.
Dangerfield, 135.&nbsp; The total polled was thus 708, or very
nearly the then average number of subscribers.</p>
<p>1815&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 29&mdash;Mr.
Herbert Cole (son of Mr. Pennel Cole, <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>for thirty years one of the surgeons
to the Worcester Infirmary) unanimously elected as house surgeon
of the institution in the place of Mr. Charles Hastings,
resigned.</p>
<p>1816&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;Sir
William Smith, Bart., furnished the matron&rsquo;s rooms at his
own cost.</p>
<p>1816&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 29&mdash;Dr. Lewis
Evans elected a physician in the room of Dr. Cameron,
resigned.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 20&mdash;At a
large meeting of the governors, Dr. Philip W. Wilson brought
forward certain charges against his brother officers of the
medical staff, as to an operation which he alleged had been
improperly performed, but the charges were dismissed by the
governors.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 24&mdash;Dr.
Philip W. Wilson retired from his post, as physician, avowedly on
the ground that his brother physicians and surgeons constantly
opposed the admission of others of the profession to witness the
operations they performed.&nbsp; Dr. Wilson&rsquo;s letter to the
public was replied to by Mr. J. H. Savigny, who thought it
undesirable that infirmaries should be turned into theatres for
display.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 2&mdash;Ordered
that, if the income arising from subscriptions and funded
property is insufficient to keep open two additional wards, then
first fitted up, a sum, not exceeding &pound;200 annually, should
be appropriated for that purpose from such legacies as should be
left to the charity, and not specially directed to be vested in
the funds.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 2&mdash;Jonas
Malden, M.D., and Charles Hastings, M.D., were appointed
physicians in the place of Drs. Philip W. Wilson, and Louis
Evans, resigned.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;<span class="smcap">February</span> 15&mdash;J. P.
Sheppard, Esq., elected surgeon in the room of Mr. Stephenson,
resigned.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;Dispute amongst the medical men as to the treatment
of surgical and medical cases.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span>&mdash;J. H.
Savigny, Esq., took the office of secretary <i>pro. tem.</i>, in
the place of Mr. Jackson, resigned.</p>
<p>1819&mdash;<span class="smcap">October</span> 29&mdash;Mr.
Matthew Pierpoint appointed surgeon in the room of Mr. Sandford,
who resigned after twenty-seven years of most useful service to
this institution.&nbsp; Mr. Pierpoint was proposed by Lord
Deerhurst, and seconded by Mr. Sandford himself.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 12&mdash;A
silver cup presented to Mr. Savigny for his various and important
services to the institution.</p>
<p>1823&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span>&mdash;An
additional wing erected in addition to the north end of the
Infirmary.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>1823&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 26&mdash;Mr.
John Eleox chosen secretary to the Infirmary, <i>vice</i> J. H.
Savigny, Esq., resigned.</p>
<p>1824&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 23&mdash;Dr. Lewis
chosen physician in the room of Dr. Woodyatt, deceased.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span>
6&mdash;Election of a physician in the room of Dr. Lewis,
resigned.&nbsp; The candidates were Dr. Nash, proposed by John
Williams, Esq., and William Wall, Esq.; and Dr. Streeten,
proposed by the Rev. Digby Smith and Major Johnson.&nbsp; At the
close of the ballot Dr. Nash was found to have 298 votes, and Dr.
Streeten 243&mdash;majority for Dr. Nash 55.</p>
<p>1827&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 8&mdash;The
governors agreed to the erection of an operating room, and other
necessary offices, at an expense of &pound;700.</p>
<p>1829&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 5&mdash;Mr. T. H.
Wheeler elected secretary, <i>vice</i> Mr. Elcox, resigned.</p>
<p>1829&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 27&mdash;Mr. T.
Carden elected surgeon, <i>vice</i> John Carden, Esq.,
resigned.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 2&mdash;The funded
property of the institution, hitherto in different stocks, was
all transferred to the Three-and-a-half per Cents. Reduced.</p>
<p>1833&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 27&mdash;At the
quarterly meeting of the governors, Earl Beauchamp in the chair,
it was announced that &pound;1,126 had been collected for the
institution during the last few months at different churches and
Dissenting chapels, which would pay off the debt of &pound;550,
due to the treasurers, and enable them to get through the next
twelve months without touching the funded property.&nbsp; Mr.
Gutch afterwards read a report of a committee which had been
appointed to inquire into the expenditure of the institution
which had, for a series of years, exceeded the income.&nbsp; They
admitted that there had been great abuses in various departments
of the institution, and especially as to the supply of drugs and
chemicals, and it was therefore recommended that a practical
chemist should be appointed on the drug committee, who, during
his appointment, should be ineligible to supply drugs.&nbsp; They
recommended also that all legacies, above &pound;100, should be
funded, with sundry other regulations.&nbsp; The report was
received, but it was determined not to publish the evidence upon
which it was founded, by a majority of 16 to 11.</p>
<p>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 4&mdash;At the
quarterly meeting of the governors, a resolution, determining
that all legacies of &pound;100 should be funded, was adopted;
and it was also resolved that the evidence taken respecting the
mal-administration of the drug department, should be referred to
a select committee.</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>1834&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 27&mdash;It
was determined to take counsel&rsquo;s opinion as to the power of
the Corporation to renew the lease of ground on which the
Infirmary stood, as it belonged to Nash&rsquo;s Charity.&nbsp;
This matter had repeatedly been under the attention of the
governors, and at last it was found necessary to obtain an Act of
Parliament, in order to legalise the lease.&nbsp; The
sub-committee reported that no further investigation that could
be made into the irregularities which had taken place, and the
discrepancy between the amount of drugs ordered and consumed,
would be satisfactory; and so the matter finally dropped.</p>
<p>1838&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 16&mdash;Election
of a surgeon, in the room of Mr. Thomas Carden, deceased.&nbsp;
There were no less than ten candidates, and a great deal of
interest was excited in the matter by peculiar circumstances
attending some of the candidates.&nbsp; John Williams, Esq., was
called to preside over the meeting, which was adjourned to the
County Courts for the sake of room.&nbsp; The chairman proposed
Mr. Edward Morris, who was seconded by William Acton, Esq.;
Colonel Davis and Mr. Sidebottom proposed Mr. J. H. Walsh; James
Morton, Esq., and R. Spooner, Esq., proposed Mr. H. D. Carden;
the Major and Mr. Duncan proposed Mr. Budd.&nbsp; An objection
had been raised to Mr. Carden because he had not been, as the
rules were considered to require, resident during the previous
twelve months in Worcester.&nbsp; Counsel&rsquo;s opinion was
taken on the point, and a very tedious and hot discussion took
place on the matter at the meeting.&nbsp; Ultimately it came to a
vote, and 106 declared Mr. Carden eligible, and 90 that he was
not.&nbsp; His name, therefore, went to the ballot, and he was
elected&mdash;having received 310 votes to 131 for Mr. Walsh, and
40 for Mr. Budd.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 30&mdash;At a
quarterly meeting of the governors, a strong resolution was
passed in reference to a disgraceful attack upon C. H. Hebb,
Esq., which had appeared in the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper.&nbsp;
Mr. Hebb having had an operation very successfully performed upon
him, presented the Infirmary with a sum of &pound;10 in token of
his thankfulness, and partly because the instruments belonging to
that institution had been employed by the operating
surgeon.&nbsp; The writer in the <i>Guardian</i> affirmed that
the instruments had been purchased solely with a view to this
very operation, and so &ldquo;the shine was taken out&rdquo; of
Mr. Hebb&rsquo;s donation.&nbsp; This proved to be utterly
false.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 19&mdash;A very
sharp contest for the office of secretary to the Infirmary, in
the room of Mr. T. H. Wheeler, <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>deceased, between Mr. John Palmer,
proposed by Mr. Curtler and Dr. Hastings&mdash;and Mr. D. W.
Nash, proposed by the Rev. T. Pearson and Mr. John Parker.&nbsp;
Mr. Nash had 216 votes, and Mr. Palmer 169.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 28&mdash;At the
quarterly meeting of the governors, the committee appointed, on
the motion of Mr. Curtler, to inquire into an alleged laxity of
attendance on the part of the medical officers of the
institution, and ill conduct of its general business, presented
their report.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler, however, had not attended the
meetings of the committee, because the medical officers all
insisted on their right to be present; and several complaints,
therefore, had not been brought before them.&nbsp; The charges,
in most of the cases investigated, seemed to be disproved; but of
the beneficial effect the inquiry had in the improved management
of the institution there can be no doubt.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler
obtained another committee, to revise the whole of the rules of
the institution.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 26&mdash;A
quarterly meeting of the governors held in the Nisi Prius Court,
at the Shire Hall, with John Williams, Esq., in the chair.&nbsp;
The medical men connected with the institution offered great
opposition to a motion of Mr. Curtler&rsquo;s to exclude the
subscribers from all meetings of committees, and give them leave
only to attend the general quarterly boards; the object being to
enable the governors to appoint select committees.&nbsp; Mr.
Curtler supported the proposition, as the usual practice of all
large bodies and institutions of this kind, and because inquiry
into the affairs of the institution by a select committee became
absolutely necessary, as the funds were being frittered away and
the rules neglected.&nbsp; The medical men said the alteration
was aimed at them, and sought their exclusion from the
committees.&nbsp; They called select committees secret
committees, and said the rules made with so much wisdom by their
ancestors ought not to be altered.&nbsp; The medical men defeated
Mr. Curtler&rsquo;s resolution by 58 to 32.</p>
<p>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 2&mdash;A
quarterly meeting of the governors held at the Shire Hall, over
which the Lord Bishop of the Diocese presided.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler
moved for a select committee, on which only two of the medical
officers of the institution should attend, to consider what
alterations were necessary in the rules.&nbsp; The medical men
insisted upon their right to be all present at the meetings of
the committee, and only yielded when the majority of the meeting
was evidently seen to be against them.&nbsp; They then agreed to
a committee of nine gentlemen, reserving the right to delegate
any two of their own body to act with them.</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>1847&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 27&mdash;At
the quarterly meeting of the governors, Mr. Curtler&rsquo;s
committee for revising the rules of the institution presented
their report.&nbsp; The medical men having given way, a great
number of alterations were recommended, and power taken to
appoint select committees, on which two of the medical officers
should always serve.&nbsp; The other medical men of the city and
neighbourhood were invited to witness operations; and the salary
of Mr. Cole, the house surgeon, increased to &pound;100 a
year.&nbsp; Mr. Curtler mentioned&mdash;as one among other things
showing how necessary inquiry had been&mdash;that the malt
supplied to the institution was enough for twice the beer that
was consumed within the walls, and that about thirty-three
hogsheads annually disappeared out of the back door.&nbsp; The
report was unanimously received.</p>
<p>1849&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 31&mdash;At the
quarterly meeting of the governors it was determined that the
&pound;840 obtained from the sale of tickets at the Jenny Lind
concert should be applied to the building of a chapel for the use
of the patients.&nbsp; The Very Rev. the Dean added another
&pound;100; and it was principally to his exertions in obtaining
what more was necessary in the way of funds, that the public and
the patients owe the very pretty erection which is now attached
to the back of the main building.</p>

204</span>WORCESTER MUSICAL FESTIVALS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the origin of the
meetings of the three choirs of Worcester, Hereford, and
Gloucester, does not belong to the nineteenth century.&nbsp; It
will be sufficient here to say that the first took place in the
year 1725 (when &pound;48. 18s. was collected), and that they
have gradually risen in importance, till, besides being the means
of obtaining annually a very large sum for the support of the
widows and orphans of the clergy, they have now taken a first
place amongst the musical <i>r&eacute;unions</i> of the kingdom,
and have greatly aided in fostering the melodious science.&nbsp;
It will be seen from the following brief notes of the festivals
at Worcester, that the most celebrated singers have, from time to
time, all taken a part in the performance here of the chief works
of the great masters of music.&nbsp; In the seventeen meetings
held here this century, upwards of &pound;14,500 have been
realised for the clergy&rsquo;s widows and orphans.</p>
<p>1800&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>

for the charity, &pound;1,083; for admission, &pound;3,997.&nbsp;
This was one of the most successful meetings ever held.&nbsp; The
Duchess of St. Albans held one of the plates the first
morning.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
14&mdash;Sermon by the Very Rev. the Dean, Lord Bishop of
Rochester.&nbsp; <i>The Messiah</i> was the only oratorio
performed.&nbsp; On the first morning the service was opened by a
funeral anthem, in commemoration of his late Majesty King George
IV.&nbsp; Principal performers&mdash;Madame Malibran, Mrs.
Knyvett, and Miss Cramer; Messrs. Braham, Phillips, Vaughan,
Knyvett, &amp;c.&nbsp; Balls were held every evening at the Town
Hall; and a banquet was given by the Bishop of Rochester and Lady
Sarah Murray, in the Chapter House, after each morning&rsquo;s
performance.&nbsp; The Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria
were among the company.&nbsp; The receipts for the charity were
&pound;1,005, and for admissions, &pound;3,314; being
considerably less than the amount realised in 1827.</p>
<p>1833&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
24&mdash;Sermon by the Bishop of Worcester.&nbsp; Every pains had
been taken to make this festival successful; the performances
occupying four mornings instead of three, and the orchestra being
much enlarged.&nbsp; About 170 performers were engaged, the
principal vocalists being&mdash;Madame Malibran, Miss Clara
Novello, and Mrs. Knyvett; Messrs. Braham, Phillips, Vaughan, and
E. Taylor.&nbsp; De Beriot, the violinist, was also a feature of
this festival.&nbsp; <i>The Messiah</i> was performed entire; and
selections from <i>The Creation</i>, <i>Palestine</i>, <i>The
Last Judgment</i>, <i>The Deluge</i> (Schneider), and <i>Mount
Sinai</i> (Neukomm)&mdash;the last proving a decided
failure.&nbsp; Malibran was all in all at this meeting.&nbsp; The
receipts for the charity were &pound;981, and for admissions,
&pound;3,496.&nbsp; The ball at the College Hall was a most
brilliant finale, the company numbering upwards of 700.&nbsp; The
expenses were no less than &pound;4,300; so that the stewards
were &pound;800 out of pocket.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
27&mdash;Sermon by the Rev. Prebendary Benson.&nbsp; <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>Principal
performers&mdash;Madame Caradori Allan, Miss Hawes, Mrs. Knyvett,
and Miss Novello; Messrs. Braham, Phillips, Vaughan, Knyvett,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The scheme contained many novelties.&nbsp; <i>The
Messiah</i> was performed on the first morning; Mozart&rsquo;s
<i>Redemption</i>, Bishop&rsquo;s cantata, <i>The Seventh
Day</i>, and a selection, the second morning; and <i>The Last
Judgment</i>, with a selection, on the third.&nbsp; <i>Acis and
Galatea</i> was sung at the first concert; the others were
entirely miscellaneous.&nbsp; The receipts exhibited a sad
falling off, being, for the charity, &pound;828, and for
admissions, &pound;2,685.&nbsp; The stewards were about
&pound;1,000 out of pocket.&nbsp; An article of <i>bijouterie</i>
was presented to Miss Clara Novello, by Colonel Clive and the
committee, as an expression of their admiration at her singing,
and of thanks for the kind manner in which she had fallen in with
the wishes of the committee as to some alterations of the
scheme.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span>
10&mdash;Sermon by the Rev. W. H. Woodgate, Rector of
Bellbroughton.&nbsp; <i>The Messiah</i>, <i>Creation</i>, and
<i>Palestine</i> performed in their entirety.&nbsp; The concerts
were all made up of miscellanea.&nbsp; Principal
performers&mdash;Miss Hawes, Miss Clara Novello, Madame Persiani,
Miss Woodyatt, Miss Beale; Messrs. Phillips, Vaughan, Bennett,
Machin, Edmunds, &amp;c.&nbsp; The receipts for the charity this
year were &pound;932, and for admissions &pound;2,820, which was
an increase upon the sum realised at the previous meeting, though
the prices of tickets were this year reduced to the sums at which
they have ever since remained.&nbsp; The expenses, however,
reached &pound;4,089, so that there was a deficiency of
&pound;1,270.</p>
<p>1842&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span> 20&mdash;The
sermon was preached by the Lord Bishop of the Diocese.&nbsp; This
festival was marked by an entire change of system and the great
success attending upon it.&nbsp; There were no foreign
&ldquo;stars&rdquo; engaged in the vocal department, and,
consequently, a great deal of expense was saved.&nbsp; The
oratorios were conducted, not by the organist of the cathedral,
Mr. Clarke, but by Mr. Surman of Exeter Hall, and the
performances were held in the nave and not in the choir.&nbsp;
The only previous occasion on which the festival had been held in
the nave was at the visit of George III, sixty years
before.&nbsp; The arrangement of orchestra and seats was that
which has been ever since observed.&nbsp; The principal singers
were&mdash;Miss Birch, Miss Marshall, Miss Dolby, Mrs. Loder, and
Miss Davis, our own young townswoman; Mr. Phillips, Mr. Leffler,
and Mr. Hobbs.&nbsp; The oratorios performed were&mdash;<i>The
Messiah</i>, <i>Judas Maccabeus</i>, and <i>Engedi</i>.&nbsp; At
the evening concerts <i>Alexander&rsquo;s Feast</i>,
Haydn&rsquo;s <i>Seasons</i>, and Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Song of
</i><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span><i>the Bell</i> were performed entire.&nbsp; The chorus
consisted of 218 singers, and there were 82 instruments in the
orchestra.&nbsp; The organ was in the course of being renewed by
Hill.&nbsp; The collections for the charity amounted to
&pound;1,059. 16s.</p>
<p>1845&mdash;Sermon by Canon Wood.&nbsp; Only three morning
performances this year, which, for the first time, were under the
conduct of Mr. Done.&nbsp; <i>The Last Judgment</i> and a
collection of anthems were performed on the Wednesday morning,
and <i>The Messiah</i> on the Thursday.&nbsp; In the evenings
<i>Acis and Galatea</i> and Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <i>Walpurgis
Nacht</i> were performed entire.&nbsp; The principal vocalists
were&mdash;the Misses Williams, Miss Rainforth, Miss Whitnall;
Herr Staudigl, Mr. Pearsall, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Machin, and Mr.
Young.&nbsp; The amount collected for the charity was &pound;850.
14s.</p>
<p>1848&mdash;Sermon by the Very Rev. the Dean of
Worcester.&nbsp; Mdlle. Jenny Lind had promised to take a part at
this festival, but Mr. Lumley compelled her to break her
engagement, and she was actually singing at Birmingham on the
first day of the Worcester meeting; notwithstanding this, the
festival was one of the most successful, in point of attendance,
which has ever been held at either of the three cities.&nbsp; On
the first morning at least 1,500 people were present in the nave
of the Cathedral, and at the last concert in the College Hall it
is computed that 1,100 persons were crammed into the room.&nbsp;
There were this year four morning performances; the oratorios
performed entire being the <i>Elijah</i> and <i>Messiah</i>, with
selections from <i>Palestine</i>, <i>Creation</i>, and
<i>Engedi</i>.&nbsp; In the evenings parts of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
<i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, Haydn&rsquo;s
<i>Seasons</i>, and Weber&rsquo;s <i>Oberon</i> were performed,
with miscellaneous selections.&nbsp; The principal vocalists
were&mdash;Mdlle. Alboni, Madame Castellan, the Misses Williams,
and Miss Dolby; Mr. Sims Reeves, Signor Lablache, Mr. Lockey, Mr.
Robinson, and Mr. Machin.&nbsp; The amount collected for the
charity was &pound;960, and the receipts by sale of tickets
reached &pound;3,080; yet the expense attaching to the engagement
of the &ldquo;stars&rdquo; was so great that the loss was very
considerable.</p>

209</span>NATURAL PHENOMENA.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is altogether beyond the
province of this work to enter into any detail of the scientific
peculiarities of the county of Worcester; but it would have been
very satisfactory to have been able to have recorded
here&mdash;besides those isolated disturbances of nature&rsquo;s
more ordinary course, which arrest the attention of indifferent
spectators&mdash;the results of observations made by competent
persons which might have formed the basis of a county
meteorology.&nbsp; But, in truth, none such exist; excepting in
the daily memoranda of one or two gentlemen extending over only a
very few years, there are no data for arriving at any conclusions
on the subject.&nbsp; As the members of the medical profession
and the scientific agriculturist become increasingly alive to the
important part which atmosphere and electricity play in the
conditions of animal and vegetable life, the want of such tables
will be severely felt.&nbsp; The city of Worcester itself stands
but thirty-six feet above the level of the sea; and, from its
peculiar position, its temperature is generally higher than that
of the surrounding country or of the kingdom generally.&nbsp;
Though Worcestershire may be considered as the central county of
England, and consequently the most inland, yet we have our fair
share of rain, and <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>perhaps even more than an average quantity.&nbsp; Such
observations as could be procured on this point will be found in
the Appendix.&nbsp; The principal part of our rain, and the
greater number of storms that visit us, come from the S.W., and
the prevailing wind is also from that quarter.&nbsp; In some
parts of the year it may be matter for every day observation to
notice the vapours, gathered apparently in the Bristol Channel,
attracted by the Malvern range, and spreading out a fan-like
nimbus towards the N.E., which distributes its fertilising
showers over Worcester and the lands lying between Bredon Hill on
the one hand and the upper Severn on the other&mdash;often over a
much more limited tract of country&mdash;while the lands beyond
seem to lie under a dry and cloudless sky.&nbsp; The following
are memoranda of the more remarkable natural phenomena which have
excited notice within the county during this century.</p>
<p>1802&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;A
hurricane occurred, doing great damage to the houses in and round
Worcester.&nbsp; The windmill at Kempsey was set on fire by the
sails being whirled round with so great rapidity.</p>
<p>1804&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;Violent
gale from S.W., doing great damage.&nbsp; A stack of chimneys
falling through the roof of the house of Mr. E. Harris, attorney,
in Edgar Street, Worcester, killed the nursemaid, who was in bed
with two children, who were but little hurt.</p>
<p>1805&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 25&mdash;The
London mail to Worcester stopped by a heavy fall of snow.</p>
<p>1807&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 10&mdash;A
violent storm occurred, which raged pretty generally over the
whole country.&nbsp; A barge laden with coal, moored near
Worcester bridge, was sunk.&nbsp; At Hanley Castle, and Stanford
Park, a great many trees were blown down, and several houses
unroofed.</p>
<p>1808&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 15&mdash;A most
awful tempest from the S.W.&nbsp; The thunder continued in one
unbroken roar for an hour and a half; and the hailstones which
fell were like fragments of a vast plate of ice broken into
pieces, being broad, flat, and ragged.&nbsp; Many of them were
perfect and unmelted the next morning.</p>
<p>1809&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 29&mdash;Great
flood upon the Severn, the water <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>rising to within nineteen inches of
the level of the extraordinary flood of 1795.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;<span class="smcap">September</span> 22&mdash;A
storm, described as &ldquo;a dreadful whirlwind,&rdquo;
commencing at Fearnal Heath, and taking a direction due north,
through Salwarp, Ombersley, Doverdale, and to the extremity of
Hampton Lovett; and its effects were felt as far as Chaddesley
Corbett.&nbsp; The principal sufferers were Sir John Pakington,
Mr. Silvester of Doverdale, and Mr. Saunders of Mayeux.&nbsp; Mr.
Silvester had two hundred trees on his farm, either torn up by
the roots, or shattered at mid-trunk.&nbsp; Most of them were
pear trees in full bearing.</p>
<p>1810&mdash;<span class="smcap">November</span> 10&mdash;A
tempest from the N.E. visited Worcester and its environs.&nbsp;
Great numbers of trees torn up by the roots.&nbsp; The lightning
struck the house of Mr. Harris of Edgar Street, came down the
chimney of the room in which he was sitting, burnt his hand and
eyebrows, his stockings and papers, and tore down a wainscot on
the opposite side of the room.</p>
<p>1811&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 27&mdash;The famous
Worcester hailstorm happened this day.&nbsp; It was indeed a
tempest, such as had been scarcely ever known in this country
before.&nbsp; Between four and five o&rsquo;clock p.m., clouds of
a horrible blackness came up from the S.E., accompanied by a
hideous noise.&nbsp; Shortly hail began to fall, which almost
immediately became a storm of ice, and fell furiously in flakes
of about five or six inches in circumference.&nbsp; The windows
of almost every house which faced the S.E. were wholly demolished
in a few minutes&mdash;gardens were laid utterly waste&mdash;and
fields, both of grass and corn, sustained irreparable
damage.&nbsp; The ice-storm was succeeded by heavy torrents of
rain, with all the terrors of a tropical tempest.&nbsp; The river
Severn <i>in one hour rose six feet</i>, and continued gradually
to swell its torrent till it had reached the height of <i>twenty
feet</i>; and the flood, rapid and wide-spreading, swept away in
its impetuous career whole herds of cattle from the adjacent
fields.&nbsp; 1,200 panes of glass were broken in Messrs.
Barr&rsquo;s china manufactory, 500 in the Workhouse, and 2,000
in Messrs. Chamberlain&rsquo;s factory.&nbsp; Messrs.
Freame&rsquo;s cabinet warehouse, Goose Lane, lost 1,000 panes,
and all the public buildings suffered severely.&nbsp; 150 rooks
were killed in the rookery at the White Ladies, and a vast many
other birds were also afterwards found dead.&nbsp; At Henwick and
Hallow the crops were miserably injured.&nbsp; The cost of
replacing the glass broken in the city, alone, was estimated at
&pound;5,000; and there being neither sufficient materials nor
workpeople at hand to repair it, the inhabitants for weeks had to
suffer the inconvenience of exposure to the weather.&nbsp; <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>One
glazier, who started off to Stourbridge and purchased all the
glass he could lay his hands on, is said to have laid the
foundation of a fortune by this calamity.&nbsp; We have no record
of the state of the atmosphere previous to this storm.</p>
<p>1814&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 12&mdash;The
Severn frozen over at Worcester, so as to admit of parties
walking across it, and the weather in every respect most
severe.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;The
frost continued with such severity that the Severn was frozen
over at Tewkesbury, and several persons going to Tewkesbury
market rode over it at the Lode.&nbsp; The roads, also, were so
blocked up by snow as to render traffic of every description
almost impossible.</p>
<p>1817&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 21&mdash;The
neighbourhood of Stanford visited with a tremendous
tempest.&nbsp; From seven to ten p.m., the roar of the thunder
was incessant; the lightning one continued sheet of fire; and the
rain descended in such torrents that the whole country was
inundated.&nbsp; The brook running from Hanley William through
Orleton rose to an enormous height, and carried away fences,
trees, and other obstacles, lodging them at great
distances.&nbsp; Many hop yards destroyed, and the soil almost
wholly washed away.&nbsp; The thermometer stood at 112&deg;
Fahrenheit in the sun, on the day before this storm, and at
82&deg; in the shade.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">March</span> 4&mdash;A very
furious storm from the S.W. experienced at Worcester, continuing
for about six hours.&nbsp; A great deal of damage done to the
roofs of houses.&nbsp; The Bristol mail was detained eleven hours
by the floods.</p>
<p>1818&mdash;<span class="smcap">April</span> 11&mdash;Great
flood on the river Severn, the water rising to within three feet
of the height which it reached in February, 1795.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 14&mdash;The
Severn frozen over.</p>
<p>1820&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 12&mdash;A
thunderstorm occurred, which was very terrific in several parts
of the county.&nbsp; A rick of hay at Mr. Coucher&rsquo;s,
Woodmanton, Clifton-on-Teme, was set on fire and wholly burnt;
and four deer were killed by the lightning in Hagley Park.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;The
Severn frozen over.</p>
<p>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 2&mdash;A very
fearful thunderstorm occurred, which was general throughout the
kingdom.&nbsp; It did not do much damage in Worcestershire.&nbsp;
At Northwick Park five deer were killed, and their bodies were
found floating in the large sheet of water there.&nbsp; Four out
of the five were six-year-old bucks; and it was surmised that,
blinded by the lightning, they ran into the water; and though
deer customarily swim well, yet they were now unable to exert
themselves and so were drowned.</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>1821&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>
24&mdash;Great floods upon the Severn, which entirely cut off the
communication between Worcester and the lower parts of the
county.&nbsp; The cellars of all the houses near the Severn were
flooded for some days.</p>
<p>1822&mdash;<span class="smcap">May</span> 20&mdash;A
destructive thunderstorm in the neighbourhood of Worcester.&nbsp;
The hailstones, which were unusually large, smashed great
quantities of glass&mdash;particularly about Spetchley, where six
hundred panes were broken in the hothouses of R. Berkeley,
Esq.&nbsp; Hailstones were picked up measuring four inches in
circumference.</p>
<p>1822&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 5&mdash;A
terrific hurricane from the S.W., which raged with more or less
violence throughout the whole of England.&nbsp; In Worcester, the
roofs of several houses were almost uncovered, and the gable end
of a newly-erected building near the House of Industry was blown
in.&nbsp; Five boats were sunk at Diglis; and at Upton bridge one
was capsized with three men in it, one of whom was drowned.&nbsp;
The coachman of the Holyhead mail was twice blown off the box,
and one of the horses dropped down dead, on arriving at Chester,
from excessive fatigue.</p>
<p>1825&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 19&mdash;A tempest
in the neighbourhood of Tenbury and Cleobury Mortimer.&nbsp; The
electric fluid struck an oak tree at Kinlet, and killed nine
sheep sheltering beneath it; set fire to the wooden steeple of
Neen Savage Church, melting the bells which it contained, and
threatening the destruction of the entire edifice.</p>
<p>1825&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span> 14&mdash;A
fearful storm of wind, hail, rain, and lightning, passed over
Worcester from the S.W., and the electric fluid displaced a stone
about half way up St. Andrew&rsquo;s spire.&nbsp; Mr. G. Parry,
farmer, of Hanbury, lost thirty-two ewes, heavy with lamb, and
valued at &pound;100.</p>
<p>1826&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 14&mdash;A storm
of wind, which blew a perfect hurricane about noon.&nbsp; A stack
of chimneys at Mr. Sidebottom&rsquo;s house, at Worcester, fell
through the roof and two floors, severely injuring a
servant.&nbsp; Trees in the neighbourhood were torn up by the
roots, walls and fences laid flat, and corn and hay ricks
unthatched and scattered.&nbsp; A considerable part of the spire
of Cleobury Mortimer Church was broken off during divine service,
and the congregation rushed out of the edifice in terror.&nbsp; A
barge, heavily laden with coal, was sunk in the Severn.</p>
<p>1828&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 8&mdash;A tempest
of considerable violence, during which the lightning struck a
house in Newdix Court, High Street, Worcester, and a cottage near
Merriman&rsquo;s Hill&mdash;not, however, doing much damage in
either case.&nbsp; Vehement gusts of wind stripped old <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>roofs of
their tiling, and blew down several trees in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>1830&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;A very
heavy fall of snow, blocking up all the roads, so that no coaches
reached Worcester at all from the west, and the London coaches
came in a day after their time.</p>
<p>1831&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 10&mdash;A tempest
which raged throughout the county, doing much damage.&nbsp; The
lightning struck Hales, a watchman of Worcester, while sitting at
the door of a house at Spetchley, and he was for a time
paralysed, while the blood flowed from his ears and mouth.&nbsp;
At Wick a cottage was burnt down, and the nephew of the widow who
occupied it was affected by the electric fluid, much in the same
manner as Hales.&nbsp; On Defford Common the hailstones lay in
hillocks nine inches high, and some of the stones were as large
as pigeon&rsquo;s eggs.&nbsp; A great deal of glass was broken,
birds killed, crops destroyed (the heads of the wheat being
separated from the straw, and the pods of beans laid open), and
fencing laid low.</p>
<p>1836&mdash;<span class="smcap">December</span>
28&ndash;30&mdash;An extraordinary snowstorm, which extended over
the greater part of the country, and continued for several days,
till all the roads were blocked up and communication almost at an
end.&nbsp; The Worcester mail was blocked up in the snow at
Enstone, and could not be got out.&nbsp; The mails for three days
were thirty-six hours behind time.&nbsp; In some places the snow
was said to have drifted to a height of twenty feet.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">January</span> 9&mdash;A
fearful gale of wind, general throughout the country, and doing
great damage to houses and plantations in this county.&nbsp; At
Burlish Common, near Stourport, a stack of chimneys fell through
the roof of a cottage on to the bed where a young woman was
lying, and she sustained such injuries as to cause her death
shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">June</span> 13&mdash;A very
violent hailstorm raged chiefly in the northern part of the
county.&nbsp; At Hagley, several hundred pounds&rsquo; worth of
glass were destroyed; and in Mr. G. B. Lea&rsquo;s spinning mill,
at Drayton, near Kidderminster, 580 small panes were
broken.&nbsp; At Hartlebury, &amp;c., great damage was done to
the growing crops&mdash;many fields of barley being totally
destroyed; and at Harvington the hailstones were reported to lie
six feet deep on the ground: fifty rooks were killed in that
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>1839&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 31&mdash;In
consequence of unintermittent rains for several days together, a
flood occurred in all the running streams, which rose higher than
had been known for many years.&nbsp; Of course, great damage was
done to the pastures and crops.&nbsp; On several roads
communication <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>was cut off.&nbsp; The Ludlow and Aberystwith mails to
Worcester were both stopped.&nbsp; The guard of the Ludlow mail
attempted to get on in a two-horse fly; but, at Newnham, the fly
was fairly floated, and the guard himself narrowly escaped
drowning.&nbsp; The Aberystwith coach was stopped at Knightsford
bridge, and had to be lashed to a tree: the bags were brought
away in boats.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 5&mdash;An alarming
tempest visited Worcester and the neighbourhood, killing several
sheep, shivering fine trees, and the subsequent hail destroying
much glass in greenhouses.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 13&mdash;A very
severe thunderstorm again occurred, igniting some farm buildings
at Abberton, killing a mare at Redditch, and doing other
damage.&nbsp; The wife of a labourer at Eastnor was struck by the
lightning, and the whole of her apparel was reduced to tinder;
the steel busk of her stays was heated to a red heat! and her
body, in consequence, frightfully burnt&mdash;nevertheless she
recovered.&nbsp; The wife of a gardener at Inkberrow, named
Hopkins, was sitting at the fireplace, when the electric fluid
came down the chimney, and striking the woman, passed along her
spine, killing her on the spot.&nbsp; The damage done to the
crops along the eastern border of the county was very great.</p>
<p>1843&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 9&mdash;A most
violent thunderstorm, whose chief fury seemed to be spent
immediately over the city of Worcester.&nbsp; Wind in S.W.&nbsp;
For two hours the thunder pealed incessantly, and the electric
fluid struck at least ten houses in the city, but without doing
any material damage at either place.&nbsp; At one house which the
lightning entered, in the Shambles, a boy was standing with an
awl in his hand, and the electric fluid severed the blade from
the haft, leaving the latter in the hand of the boy!</p>
<p>1845&mdash;<span class="smcap">July</span> 6&mdash;A terrific
thunderstorm, extending over all the S.W. and midland counties of
England, broke this evening over Worcester, just as the several
congregations were leaving their respective places of
worship.&nbsp; Just before the hurricane of rain commenced, the
whole clouded sky was covered with a lurid glare, as if from the
reflection of a distant conflagration.&nbsp; A great number of
fine trees were uprooted, especially near Bewdley.&nbsp; At
Witley Court, great damage was done to the windows and
conservatories; at Pershore the hailstones were, in fact, large
pieces of ice, and some 2,000 panes of glass were broken.</p>
<p>1846&mdash;<span class="smcap">August</span> 1&mdash;A violent
thunderstorm, which did considerable damage in some parts of
England, but not much in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; Two lambs,
belonging to J. Lea, Esq., of The Shrubbery, Kidderminster, were
killed by the lightning.</p>

216</span>MISCELLANEOUS OCCURRENCES.</h2>
<h3>1800.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present century opened in a
tempest of war and confusion, which gave little prospect of soon
exhausting its fury.&nbsp; Mention will be found below of several
serious riots on account of the high price of provisions, which
may be thus accounted for: The exemption from cash payments in
1797 had given great relief to the merchants and tradespeople
generally, but had little effect upon the condition of the
working classes; and the war had not yet withdrawn so many men
from productive industry as materially to raise the rate of
wages.&nbsp; The total number of levies for the army, from the
commencement of the war to the end of 1800, was but
208,388.&nbsp; It had, however, continued sufficiently long to
raise the price of all provisions enormously, and the very
deficient harvests of 1799 and 1800 greatly increased this evil,
and added to the distress.&nbsp; So much disquiet was excited by
these causes that Parliament was called together for a second
sitting in November, and all sorts of expedients were resorted to
to increase the supply of food&mdash;bounties were granted on the
importation of foreign corn&mdash;the use of corn in
distilleries, or for making starch, was prohibited&mdash;<a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>the
manufacture of fine flour, or the use of it in making bread, was
forbidden, while the use of oats and barley was permitted and
encouraged&mdash;bakers were prohibited from selling bread that
had not been baked twenty-four hours&mdash;and, lastly, in the
month of December His Majesty issued a proclamation exhorting the
strictest economy in families on the use of every kind of grain,
recommending that people should abstain from pastry, and on no
account allow the consumption of bread in their households to
exceed one quartern loaf for each person in a week.&nbsp;
Statutes against &ldquo;engrossing and regrating,&rdquo; that had

country magistrates and chief justices, though the great Holt had

families as much as possible, and earnestly recommended the same

better.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 15&mdash;The Mayor and
magistrates of Worcester attempted to enforce sanitary
regulations&mdash;such as cleansing &ldquo;the kennels,&rdquo;

disorders.&rdquo;</p>

because the bakers in Worcester were unprovided with bread to
sell, the populace assembled as soon as it was dark and began to
demolish their windows, but the disturbance was soon put a stop
to by the magistrates.&nbsp; A sudden rise in the price of flour
on the previous Saturday had prevented the bakers from supplying

<h3>1801.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> February, this year, Mr. Pitt
unexpectedly retired, and Mr. Addington was called to the
King&rsquo;s Councils, a fact principally to be attributed to the
ill success of the war which had been entered into with France,
and continued at a cost of blood and treasure totally
disproportionate to its advantages.&nbsp; The new ministry, from
the moment of entering office, declared <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>peace to be
their aim, and the preliminary articles were signed in London in
October.&nbsp; This war, which had lasted for eight years, cost
us &pound;427,000,000, and at the end of it the only additional
possessions we retained were Trinidad and the Dutch holdings in
Ceylon.&nbsp; In consequence of the harvest in 1800 being almost
an entire failure, the high price of provisions continued to
create much distress amongst the poor, and the bounties on flour
imported from America were increased.&nbsp; The Three per Cents.
fluctuated between 54&frac34;, in January, and 69&frac12;, in
October: average price about 61.&nbsp; Wheat averaged 69s.

Worcester women, on account of the high price of
provisions&mdash;20d. being asked for a pound of butter; 2s. a
peck for potatoes; and 9d. a pound for meat.&nbsp; The mob of
women prevented the Birmingham &ldquo;badgers&rdquo; from
carrying off their purchases, and then, assembling before a
baker&rsquo;s shop in Broad Street, compelled his wife to throw
out to them all the bread she had in the house.&nbsp; Special
constables were at last sworn in and tranquillity restored.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 27&mdash;Price of the quartern
loaf fixed by the Mayor of Worcester at 1s. 7d., though selling
the same day in London at 1s. 4&frac12;d.&nbsp; Constant
complaints that the markets at Worcester were higher than
elsewhere, and as this continued to be the case, a Mr. B. Lloyd
purchased, in June, 1,000 barrels of American flour at Liverpool,
and sold them here in single barrels.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 20&mdash;Two vagrants,
confined in the County Bridewell, forced out a window, and,
dropping themselves over a wall twenty feet high, made good their
escape.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 17&mdash;The committee of the
Worcester Flour and Bread Institution reported, that since the
previous October, 100,000 loaves had been sold to the poor by its

distributed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 30&mdash;The Directors of the

rates.&nbsp; The average number of poor relieved in <a

the house, during the previous twelve months, had been 583
weekly! while in 1795 it was only 235.&nbsp; The Directors
attributed this increase to the high price of food and the
sickliness of the season, and said it was not greater than in
other manufacturing towns.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 5&mdash;Miss Mellon
performed at Worcester Theatre to crowded houses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 14&mdash;Dinner at the

with a severe accident while hunting, one of his horse&rsquo;s
legs dropping into a deep hole and falling back upon his
lordship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 10&mdash;An advertisement
having been inserted in the Worcester papers, by the Hon. Mr.
Ward, stating that he intended to offer himself as a candidate
for Worcester at the next general election, the Corporation met
and voted unanimously that &ldquo;as there is no vacancy in the
representation of the city, the Corporation considered that an
insuperable bar to their countenancing a contest from any quarter
whatever, having had woful experience how destructive it is of
peace and good neighbourhood, which happily has prevailed among
all ranks of citizens for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 14&mdash;Both the
Worcester members, Mr. Wigley and Mr. Robarts, voted in a
minority of 22 to 80, to continue the restrictions on the use of

account of the Peace.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 21&mdash;Considerable
festivities at Witley Court, on Lord Foley attaining his
majority.&nbsp; A very large sum distributed amongst the poor of
the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>1802.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> confirmation of the Peace of
Amiens diffused universal joy, and the harvest of 1801 having
been tolerably abundant, much less pressure was experienced on
account of the price of bread.&nbsp; Three per Cents. stood at
about 70&frac12;.&nbsp; Wheat averaged 69s. 10d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 9&mdash;C. Thellusson,

the occasion by the Corporation of Worcester, and forwarded to
the Earl of Coventry, as recorder of the city, for
presentation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 9&mdash;The Hon. Mr. Ward
attained his majority, and the event was celebrated at Himley
with great rejoicings.&nbsp; A barrel of beer, called &ldquo;Big
Ben,&rdquo; containing 1,000 gallons, which had been brewed at
the birth of Mr. Ward, was tapped on the occasion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 8&mdash;The Yeomanry assembled
on the <i>Sunday</i>, as requested, and received the thanks of
His Majesty and the Parliament.&nbsp; Each troop, henceforth,
reduced to forty rank and file.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 29&mdash;Lord Nelson,
accompanied by Sir William and Lady Hamilton, visited Worcester,
on their return from a tour through South Wales.&nbsp; He was met
on the road by a great number of people, who drew his carriage
into the city: visited the china manufactory; was received by the
Mayor and Corporation at the Town Hall; entertained at a

with the freedom of the city in a china vase from Messrs.

in this county, and was presented with the freedom of the
city.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 10&mdash;The magistrates
of Worcester published a correct list of fairs, &amp;c., because
the difference between the Old and New Styles being then thirteen
days instead of twelve, great uncertainty prevailed respecting
the days on which they actually took place, and people frequently
arrived &ldquo;a day after the fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hollow peace proved very
short-lived.&nbsp; Buonaparte being evidently bent on the
subjugation of the entire continent, and the British refusing to
evacuate Malta till they had satisfaction as to his designs, war
was again declared in May this year.&nbsp; The return to
hostilities seemed as much to please the nation at large as the
peace had done only the year before.&nbsp; On the threat of
invasion arose that unparalleled volunteer enthusiasm to which
many of the following memoranda have reference.&nbsp; Consols
fluctuated from 73 in January to 52 in October; average price,
about 60.&nbsp; Price of wheat, 58s. 10d.</p>

Mr. Alderman Mather.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 1&mdash;The Venerable

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Pitt</span>, having strengthened his
hands by the addition of Addington, now Viscount Sidmonth, and
his friends, returned to office; the war with Buonaparte was
carried on with fresh vigour, and the volunteers at home were
fired with an increase of patriotic ardour.&nbsp; The number of

Volunteer drums, in consequence of a report that the French had
landed, 50,000 strong.&nbsp; The Volunteers immediately
assembled, shouldered their muskets, and set off towards
Worcester with immense alacrity and amid the enthusiastic cheers
of their wives and sweethearts.&nbsp; After marching some three

intended merely by way of proof and exercise.&nbsp; So they
marched back again, in ire and chagrin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 10&mdash;Colours, worked by

Trafalgar, filled all men&rsquo;s hearts and mouths towards the
close of the year.&nbsp; The war was fast becoming popular; for
though the taxes were enormous, our taxable income, which in 1792
appears not to have exceeded &pound;130,000,000, had increased to
&pound;220,000,000.&nbsp; A great proportion of the vast war

the physicians and surgeons of Worcester, the former (Dr.
Cameron, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Barnett) declaring that they would
not meet the surgeons in consultation in any medical cases unless

physicians.&nbsp; They defined the department of the surgeon to
be&mdash;any external or local disease unaccompanied by any

nuts in a wood at Crowle, accidentally removed a piece of turf,
and found beneath it a trap door and chimney.&nbsp; He called
several men to the spot, who immediately descended through the
door, and discovered a subterranean cave divided into several
apartments with much care and ingenuity.&nbsp; In one of the
rooms there was a quantity of cold meat, and in another a number
of skins with entrails, &amp;c.&nbsp; It had evidently been the
retreat of sheepstealers and general thieves, though none

<h3>1806.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> year Pitt and Fox both passed
from the scene.&nbsp; Pitt was only in the forty-seventh year of
his age; and though he had conducted the affairs of the kingdom
during a longer period, and with greater popularity, than perhaps
any other statesman in modern times, yet he may be said to have
died of chagrin at the defeat of all his favourite schemes.&nbsp;
Grenville and Fox succeeded him at the helm of affairs, and the
general <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>election which then took place furnished them with a
strong body of supporters in the House of Commons.&nbsp; The new
ministry were pacifically inclined, but found it impossible to
negociate with Buonaparte.&nbsp; A loan of twenty millions was
negociated to carry on the war, and the property tax increased
from 6&frac14; to 10 per cent.&nbsp; Consols stood at about 60;
wheat averaged 79s. 1d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 19&mdash;A Malvern
carrier, returning to Worcester, drove his horse and cart over
the side of Powick bridge, at a place where the wall had fallen
down and the road broken in.&nbsp; He was carried a considerable
distance down the stream, but help came in time to save his
life.&nbsp; The dangerous state of the bridge was accounted for
by there being a dispute between the Earl of Coventry and the
parish of Powick, as to who was liable to the repairs.&nbsp; The
matter had been tried at Gloucester Assizes in 1802, and a
verdict given for the parish; nevertheless, his lordship had not
repaired it.</p>

<h3>1807.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> abolition of the slave trade,
under the short Grenville ministry, must ever be remembered as
the feature of this year.&nbsp; Lord Howick having brought in a
bill for securing to all His Majesty&rsquo;s subjects the
privilege of serving in the army or navy without regard to
religious opinions, the King&rsquo;s &ldquo;scruples&rdquo; were
aroused, and he called a new administration, with the Duke of
Portland at its head, to his councils.&nbsp; They dissolved <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Parliament,
and the elections were attended with great excitement.&nbsp; By
means of the cry of &ldquo;the Church in danger,&rdquo; a
remarkable reaction was effected, and the ministry found
themselves commanding large majorities in the new House.&nbsp;
One of the first acts of the new ministry was one which marked by
how long an interval they were separated from the minister in
whose steps they professed to follow.&nbsp; At the request of our
merchants, whose ships were under various disadvantages from
which those of neutral states were free, they issued Orders in
Council that neutral vessels, <i>whithersoever bound</i>, should
put into some port connected with England, and there obtain a
license to continue their trade!&nbsp; A general suspension of
American navigation and trade consequently took place, and these
orders eventually led to the war with America in 1812.&nbsp; They
contributed also in various ways to the depreciation of our bank
paper, and their folly was thus terribly and speedily avenged
upon ourselves.&nbsp; Consols averaged 63; wheat averaged 75s.

Gloucester visited Worcester, and proceeded to Witley

<p><span class="smcap">Matters</span> at home remained quiet, and
much as in the preceding year, the public mind being taken up
with the expedition to Spain, discussing the battle of Vimiera,
and Convention of Cintra.&nbsp; Three per Cents. stood as high in
June as 70&#8540;, and averaged throughout the year
65&frac12;.&nbsp; This was the only year during this century in
which our exports of wheat exceeded our imports: average price,
81s. 4d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 2&mdash;The mail from
Birmingham to Bristol took on two passengers only from Worcester,
a young lady named Capper and a little child.&nbsp; On getting to
Severn Stoke the horses became restive, and at Ripple altogether
ran away.&nbsp; The reins broke, and both coachman and guard got
down to stop the horses, but were unable <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>to do so,
and the coach was soon out of their sight.&nbsp; The young lady,
while the vehicle was at its utmost speed, became so alarmed that
she threw herself out of the coach door, and her neck was broken
by the fall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 26&mdash;The Mayor of Worcester
committed two journeymen bootmakers to prison for combining with
others against their master, Mr. J. Garner, to demand an increase
of wages.&nbsp; It was shown that industrious men could obtain at
that trade from 30s. to 50s. a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 6&mdash;Lieutenant Carden,
of the Worcester militia, on his return from Ombersley was
stopped close to the Barbourne turnpike by three recruits, and
forced to deliver up his gold watch and money.&nbsp; They
afterwards beat a girl, and attempted to rob the Bewdley post
boy; but Mr. Carden having raised an alarm as soon as he got into
the town, a number of people started after them, and two out of
the three were apprehended the same night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parliament</span> was principally occupied
with the inquiry which led to the Duke of York&rsquo;s
resignation of the commandership of the army.&nbsp; Money was so
plentiful that a loan of eleven millions was raised at a lower
rate of interest than the public creditor had ever before
consented to receive.&nbsp; Consols stood at 68; harvest
indifferent; wheat averaged 97s. 4d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The first steps taken
to establish a Lancastrian school in Worcester.&nbsp; Up to this
time there had been no day school at which it was possible for
the children of the poor to obtain an education.&nbsp; Sunday
schools had only been established a few years&mdash;<a

Angel Street Chapel (Independent), opened in 1797, being the
first.&nbsp; In April, Mr. Lancaster lectured on education, at
the Hoppole Inn; and a meeting was held at the Unicorn, John
Williams, Esq., in the chair, at which resolutions were come to
to open a Lancastrian school immediately&mdash;all religious
parties uniting in its support on the common basis of the
scriptures; the Apostles&rsquo; Creed and Dr. Watts&rsquo;s hymns
being taught to all the children, and the Church Catechism to
those only whose parents requested it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 26&mdash;A fire broke out,
about eleven p.m., in the china manufactory of Messrs. Grainger,
Wood, and Co., Lowesmoor, Worcester, which in the course of two
hours reduced the whole premises to ruins.&nbsp; The property was
insured, but not by any means to its full amount.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 5&mdash;In the <i>Worcester
Herald</i> of this date the Rev. Thomas Foley, rector of
Oldswinford, published, as an advertisement, a long vindication
of Joanna Southcote.&nbsp; The charge of her having sold her
&ldquo;seals&rdquo; for half-a-crown a piece he declared to be
&ldquo;an infamous falsehood;&rdquo; as she gave them away
without money and without price &ldquo;to all that had faith to
believe in her inspired writings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He concluded by
giving a summary of her doctrines in most enthusiastic
language.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 31&mdash;The toll on foot
passengers passing over Worcester bridge discontinued, as the
flourishing state of the receipts had reduced the debt to
&pound;5,000.&nbsp; The first stone of the present bridge was
laid in 1771, and it was opened to the public in 1781.&nbsp; The
bridge and quays cost &pound;29,843.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 22&mdash;A young woman, named
Harris, most inhumanly murdered at Honeyborne, near
Evesham.&nbsp; She was called up from bed, and, on opening the
door, was attacked by some person with a pitchfork, and at last
dragged to a horsepond and drowned in it.&nbsp; Suspicion fell on
a young man by whom she was pregnant, but the coroner&rsquo;s
jury returned a verdict of &ldquo;Wilful murder against some
person or persons unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; The murderer was never
discovered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 25&mdash;The celebration of

guests were present; and a ball at the College Hall.&nbsp; A
great number of benefactions throughout the county from the rich
to their poorer brethren.&nbsp; Meetings in all the towns of the
county to present addresses to the King.&nbsp; The debtors in the
County Gaol were <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 13&mdash;Thomas Freeman,
glove manufacturer, fined &pound;50 by the magistrates of
Worcester, for having in his possession four oil leather skins
and eleven pairs of gloves, which had been purloined from other

<h3>1810.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Considerable</span> commercial
embarrassment was experienced this year; not, however, arising
from the unprecedented situation in which England found herself
placed&mdash;in having almost single handed to oppose the growing
power of Buonaparte&mdash;but from speculative trading in the
markets of South America.&nbsp; The depreciation of bank paper
procured the appointment of a bullion committee.&nbsp; The early
part of the year was occupied with the affair of Sir Francis
Burdett; and the latter with the appointment of the Prince of
Wales as Regent, in consequence of the increasing incompetence of
the King to attend to business.&nbsp; Consols stood at 68.&nbsp;
The imports of wheat this year amounted to 1,491,300 quarters;
average price, 106s. 5d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 10&mdash;At the Lent Assizes,

<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 11&mdash;A Sir Francis Burdett

to the County Gaol for being concerned in it, and the mob in
Worcester attempted their rescue, and broke to pieces the
carriage in which they were being conveyed.&nbsp; They also broke
the windows of several obnoxious persons; but the magistrates,
with the help of the Yeomanry and Militia then on duty in the
city, very speedily repressed the tumult.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 6&mdash;The Boys&rsquo;

<h3>1811.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> military operations on the
continent, and the large amount of specie sent abroad in the
previous year for the purchase of corn, continued and increased
the depreciation in the value of bank paper; and upon Lord King
giving notice to his tenants that he should require his rents
paid in guineas&mdash;or, if in notes, at an increase of
&pound;17. 10s. per cent. upon their nominal value&mdash;a bill
was hastily passed which made it illegal to give more money for
gold coin than was authorised by the mint, or to take Bank of
England notes for less than their ostensible value!&nbsp; The
other Parliamentary event of the year was the signal defeat of
Lord Sidmouth&rsquo;s attempt to abrogate the Toleration Act, by
requiring that Dissenting ministers should find six householders
to answer for their respectability, before a license could be
granted to them to preach.&nbsp; Consols stood at 64; wheat

Worcester&mdash;none having before existed.&nbsp; They took very
active steps in preserving the river from illegal and injurious
fishing, and a great number of condemned nets and wheels were
publicly burnt in the Corn Market.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 8&mdash;The Directors of
the Worcester House of Industry issued a considerable number of
copper tokens, which were much in demand on account of the great
want of small change in the country.&nbsp; The exchange was
immediately vested in the funds, and the interest applied to the
assistance of the poor rates.&nbsp; A meeting of tradesmen was
afterwards held (Mr. W. Beeken in the chair) at which resolutions
were unanimously passed to resist the introduction of any other
copper tokens into the trade of the city excepting those issued
by Government and the Worcester House of Industry.&nbsp; They
asserted that there was a sufficiency of copper coinage in the
country.&nbsp; A counter meeting of manufacturers was held at the
Star and Garter immediately afterwards, asserting that the
business of the city could not be carried on without more change,
and they, therefore, determined to continue the issue of their
own penny and halfpenny tokens, which they declared to be equal
in weight to the legal coin of the realm, and that they always
paid twenty shillings in the pound for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Percival&rsquo;s</span> ministry was
continuing to increase in power and in popularity, principally on
account of the warm support which they had given to the Spanish
cause, when Mr. Percival himself was suddenly assassinated in the

Prince Regent, by the Earl of Moira and Lord Wellesley, had
unsuccessfully, and to all appearance insincerely, negociated for
the formation <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>of a new ministry, in which Lords Grey and Grenville
should have a part, the Earl of Liverpool was appointed First
Lord of the Treasury, and the rest of the old ministry remained
as before.&nbsp; The Regent henceforth forsook the Whig friends
of his youth, and became a good Tory.&nbsp; The orders in council
respecting navigation, which had been so obnoxious to the
Americans were repealed under Lord Liverpool.&nbsp; A motion,
pledging Parliament to an early consideration of the Catholic
claims, was carried in the Commons by 300 to 215, but defeated in
the Lords by 174 to 103.&nbsp; The Parliament, having nearly run
out its term, was dissolved in October; but the elections did not
produce much excitement, or change in the position of
parties.&nbsp; Considerable disturbances took place in the
manufacturing districts, on the introduction of new
machinery.&nbsp; The Three per Cents. did not average 60
throughout the year; wheat averaged 126s. 6d.</p>

to seventy millions, and to meet this great demand the sinking
fund was trenched upon, for it was found impossible to raise new
taxes, though the rise of prices and the extended circulation of
bank notes had, hitherto, enabled the country to meet the
extraordinary demands upon it without difficulty.&nbsp; Mr.
Vansittart, in his financial statement this year, said he thought
the sinking fund had reached a point beyond which its operations
ought not to go; it would be very prejudicial to pay off too much
of the National Debt at once!&nbsp; The war which had now broken
out with America was of course very injurious to our
commerce.&nbsp; A bill for the relief of the Catholics was
brought in this year by Mr. Grattan, and its general principle
affirmed by a considerable majority, but an amendment, excluding
Catholics from a seat in Parliament, being carried, by a majority
of four, the bill was abandoned.&nbsp; Three per Cents. stood at

Five wild rabbits were singly turned off at an assigned distance
before a dog fox, trained for the purpose by Mr. Charles Tearne
of Stockton; and after an excellent course of about 400 yards,
were severally killed by Reynard in capital style.&nbsp; A large
concourse of people were assembled to witness this singular
sport.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 2&mdash;The clergy of the
diocese met in the audit room, and agreed to a petition against
the Catholic claims.&nbsp; This was the occasion <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>of a series
of letters between Mr. T. Hornyold, who accused the clergy of
illiberality, and the Rev. J. J. Denham Cookes.&nbsp; Mr.
Hornyold distinctly disclaimed the temporal authority of the
Pope.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 8&mdash;The Worcester
Corporation voted the sum of 100 guineas for the relief of the
Russians in their contest with the French, and a general
subscription list was opened at the banks.&nbsp; At the same
meeting it was unanimously resolved to instruct the
representatives of the city to oppose the Catholic claims.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 23&mdash;An auxiliary to the
Bible Society formed for the city and county of Worcester.&nbsp;
Several attempts had been made to effect this before, but it was
said that it would be in opposition to the Christian Knowledge
Society; and other obstacles were thrown in the way.&nbsp; Only
four or five clergymen of the Church of England were present at
the first meeting.&nbsp; It was, however, very warmly taken up in
the first instance by the resident gentry, the Earl of Coventry
accepting the presidency; and Lord Deerhurst took the chair at
the preliminary meeting, held in the Guildhall, at which the High
Sheriff of the county and the Mayor of the city were also
present, and took part.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Burns, Rev. Mr.
Steinkopff, and Rev. Mr. Hughes were the deputation from the
Parent Society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 8&mdash;The fine Wesleyan
chapel in Pump Street, Worcester, opened, with sermons by Dr.
Adam Clarke.&nbsp; The collections amounted to &pound;412.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 12&mdash;A meeting of
freeholders at the White Lion, Upton-upon-Severn, with Lord
Somers in the chair, to deliberate on the propriety of inclosing
Malvern Chace.&nbsp; The meeting agreed to a petition in favour
of such a scheme.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Local Acts</span>&mdash;For paving,
cleansing, lighting, and watching the town of Kidderminster; for
effecting an exchange of lands belonging to the Bishopric and the
Dean and Chapter of Worcester; for enclosing lands at North
Piddle, Salwarp, and Flyford Flavell.</p>
<h3>1814.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Peace</span> was at last announced, and
its advent was hailed with the utmost enthusiasm by the whole
nation, who expected that it would bring with it unnumbered
blessings; but its immediate effects seemed to be only
disastrous.&nbsp; The reduction of our military forces threw
great numbers of men into the labour market, and <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>wages were
reduced.&nbsp; While the renewed freedom of navigation brought
abundance of all kinds of raw produce to our ports, it did not
bring any corresponding increase of our foreign trade and exports
to reimburse us, for British merchants had pushed their
speculative supplies to the continent, beyond prudential limits,
in spite of the Berlin and Milan decrees.&nbsp; For instance, tea
and other goods had been sent to Germany, from the port of
Salonichi, in Greece, whence they were carried two thousand miles
on the backs of mules.&nbsp; The war too had impoverished our
customers.&nbsp; Three per Cents. fluctuated in April from 72 to
62, and averaged throughout the year 67.&nbsp; The harvest this
year was abundant, and corn fell to 74s. 4d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 19&mdash;A subscription set
on foot for the relief of the poor of Worcester.&nbsp; About
&pound;700 raised and distributed in coals.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 10&mdash;The populace burned
an effigy of Buonaparte on occasion of the Allies entering
Paris.&nbsp; Great rejoicings in other towns of the county.&nbsp;
On the 7th and 8th of June there was a general illumination at
Worcester on account of the proclamation of Peace.&nbsp;
Rejoicings at the various county towns, and at many
gentlemen&rsquo;s seats&mdash;particularly at Stanford.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 6&mdash;The Grand Duchess of
Oldenburgh, sister to the Emperor of Russia, visited Worcester
with her suite.&nbsp; Inspected Messrs. Flight, Barr, and
Barr&rsquo;s royal porcelain manufactory, and Mr. John
Knapp&rsquo;s glove manufactory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 17&mdash;The first steam
boat made its appearance below Gloucester, intended for the
conveyance of passengers and light goods between Gloucester and
Worcester.&nbsp; It made the return voyage to Gloucester in four
hours and a half.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 5&mdash;Prince Frederick
of Orange visited Worcester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 18&mdash;Mr. Kean
performed at Worcester Theatre this (Saturday) evening as
<i>Richard III</i>, and on the following Monday morning as
<i>Hamlet</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 26&mdash;A splendid silver
vase, valued at two hundred guineas, and the freedom of the city
presented to Colonel Henry Walton Ellis, of the 23rd Fusiliers, a
native of Worcester, who had most honourably distinguished
himself in Holland, Egypt, <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>America, the West Indies, and the
Peninsular War.&nbsp; The Earl of Coventry was the
presentee.&nbsp; Colonel Ellis fell in the following June at
Waterloo.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Local Acts</span>&mdash;For enclosing
lands at Bayton, Ombersley, Inkberrow, Abberley, Norton, and
Strensham; for vesting in Lord Somers the right of presentation
to the perpetual curacy of Stoulton; for taking down Ombersley
Church, erecting a new one, enlarging the churchyard, and
building a workhouse at Ombersley.</p>
<h3>1815.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> enactment of a new and more
stringent Corn Law was the most important proceeding of our
Parliament this year.&nbsp; In the early years of our commercial
history, prohibitions were laid upon the exportation of corn, but
these were gradually relaxed, and in 1688 a bounty of 5s. per
quarter was offered, on exportation, till the home price had
reached 48s., while a duty of 6s. to 8s. per quarter was levied
on imported wheat, while the price ranged between 53s. 4d. and
80s. a quarter.&nbsp; In 1766, on the apprehension of scarcity,
this was entirely reversed, exportation was prohibited, and
importation was free.&nbsp; In 1774 a duty of 6d. a quarter was
levied on all imports of wheat, which were not permitted till the
price had reached 48s. in the home market.&nbsp; In 1791 this
duty was raised to 2s. 6d. a quarter, and in 1804 the importation
price was fixed at 63s. a quarter, instead of 48s.&nbsp; Such is
a brief history of English Corn Laws down to this period.&nbsp;
In the session 1812&ndash;13, when prices were beginning to
decline, a committee was appointed to inquire into the working of
the Corn Laws, and though their report was very meagre in
information, it yet created great alarm throughout the country,
and meetings were everywhere held to petition against any
alteration of the existing law, which might prevent the people
enjoying that which they had looked forward to as one of the <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>greatest
blessings of peace&mdash;cheap bread.&nbsp; In May, 1814, Sir
Henry Parnell succeeded in carrying a resolution permitting the
free exportation of corn, be the price what it might; and it was
intended to have fixed an import duty of 24s. 3d. upon wheat
until it rose to 63s., and a sliding scale from that price to
86s.; but the opposition it evoked in the country was so strong
that the project was abandoned.&nbsp; The House of Commons
resumed the discussion of the Corn Laws on February 22, 1815, and
after two evenings&rsquo; debate it was resolved, by a majority
of 209 to 65, that wheat should not be imported till the price
was 80s. a quarter.&nbsp; Immediately the country was in arms; on
the very next day a petition was presented from the Corporation
and liverymen of London, which had received 40,000 signatures in
ten hours, praying that no alteration might take place.&nbsp; On
the 3rd of March Mr. Vansittart moved the second reading of the
Corn Bill; and an attempt to delay it till the following week, to
allow time for the country to petition, was rejected by a
majority of 171.&nbsp; On the 6th of March the House went into
committee, but that evening the populace of the metropolis had
surrounded the House, and insisted on stopping every member, and
sought to make them pledge themselves to vote against the
obnoxious measure; a Mr. Croker was in particular very
ill-treated, and the Speaker sent for a detachment of the Life
Guards, who continued to surround the House for the rest of the
evening.&nbsp; A very high debate upon this matter took place in
the House itself, but nothing availed to stay the progress of the
measure, and it was carried through committee that evening by
majorities varying from 120 to 180.&nbsp; The Bill was read a
third time, and passed on the 16th of March.&nbsp; It was carried
rapidly through the Lords by large majorities, and on the 23rd it
received the royal assent.&nbsp; The principal opponents <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>of the
measure were Mr. Baring, Mr. Phillips, Sir R. Peel, Mr.
Protheroe, &amp;c.&nbsp; It did not however answer the purpose of
keeping up prices, for they gradually sank lower and lower till
they were considerably below 60s. per quarter, and farmers,
holding their lands on lease, constantly appeared in the
<i>Gazette</i>.&nbsp; The average price of wheat this year was
65s. 7d.; and Consols stood at 60.&nbsp; For an account of the
meetings held, and the steps taken, in this county to protest
against the enactment of the Corn Laws, see ante, pp. 61, 63.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 19&mdash;Lord Somers
addressed the lords of manors and proprietors of freeholds on
Malvern Chace, announcing his intention of giving up all further
attempts to bring about an enclosure of the same.&nbsp; He found
it impossible to reconcile so many conflicting interests.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 26&mdash;Mr. Charles
Matthews gave his celebrated entertainment, called &ldquo;Mail
Coach Adventures,&rdquo; at Worcester Theatre.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 18&mdash;On the glorious field
of Waterloo, Lieutenant Colonel Lygon commanded the Life
Guards.&nbsp; Lord Sandys, then Lord Arthur Hill, was an A.D.C.
to the Duke of Wellington.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 4&mdash;The Worcester and
Birmingham Canal opened.&nbsp; The first act for the cutting of
this canal was passed on the 9th June, 1791.&nbsp; From the
Severn to Tardebigg (15 miles) there is a rise of 428 feet, with
71 locks.&nbsp; From Tardebigg to the Birmingham Canal (14 miles)
is level.&nbsp; At West Heath it passes through a tunnel 2,700
yards long.&nbsp; In the first and subsequent acts power was
taken to raise no less a sum than &pound;657,500; the original
number of proprietors being only 1,800.&nbsp; It has throughout
been an unfortunate concern; for the first act is filled with
guarantees to other canals and opposing interests, which have
hung like a millstone round the necks of the proprietors.&nbsp;
From Tardebigg to Birmingham the canal is of greater capacity
than in the part nearer the Severn.&nbsp; The company is now,
however, about to be absorbed into the Old Birmingham Canal
Company, and matters will, probably, henceforth wear a different
aspect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;The celebrated
Elliston opened Worcester Theatre for one season.&nbsp; There
being amongst his company the Misses Brunton, Mr. and Mrs.
Keeley, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Local Acts</span>&mdash;For taking down
and rebuilding the parish church of St. Thomas, Dudley; for
enabling the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company to complete
and extend their works.</p>
<h3><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>1816.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a truly gloomy year.&nbsp;
Agriculturists, manufacturers, and tradespeople all alike
experienced the depression resulting from the sudden change from
war to peace; and it was felt the more, as it was so totally
unexpected.&nbsp; The harvest was exceedingly unproductive, and
the farmers got no relief by the high prices which corn
fetched&mdash;for the quality of home-grown corn was poor in the
extreme.&nbsp; The sudden reduction of paper money in circulation
had much to do with this untoward state of things; the
understanding that the Bank was to return to cash payments
immediately, had compelled them to reduce the quantity of notes
in circulation, and the metallic currency had either been bought
up privately and converted into bullion, or sent abroad.&nbsp;
The ministry proposed to continue the property and income tax,
but such was the feeling of the country against it, on the score
of its being only a war tax, that it was rejected by a majority
of 238 to 201, and the ministers were obliged to borrow to make
up the year&rsquo;s deficit.&nbsp; Three per Cents. averaged 61;
wheat averaged 78s. 6d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 22&mdash;Henry Wakeman,
Esq., of Perdiswell, at his audit for Claines, made a reduction
in his tithes of &pound;20 per cent., an example which was pretty
generally imitated by the large titheowners throughout the
county.&nbsp; The reason alleged was &ldquo;the great declension
in value of all farming produce.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wheat now selling
at 6s. a bushel in Worcester market.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 29&mdash;A Worcestershire
Agricultural Society established, at a meeting held at the
Hoppole; Lord Viscount Elmley in the chair.&nbsp; Lord Foley, Sir
Thomas Winnington, Sir William Smith, &amp;c., were among its
first supporters.&nbsp; Its first exhibition of stock took place
in June, when &pound;40 was distributed in prizes (which were all
carried off by five persons); but, after languishing for a year
or two, it was given up for want of support.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;The Messrs. Chamberlain
ordered to attend at Warwick <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>House, with specimens of porcelain
for the Princess Charlotte, who gave them a large order in
anticipation of her approaching marriage.&nbsp; Messrs. Flight,
Barr, and Barr were afterwards honoured with an order.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 12&mdash;Miss Foote
performed in <i>The Honeymoon</i> at Worcester Theatre.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 18&mdash;A subscription
entered into for the relief of the poor of Worcester.&nbsp; The
gross amount collected was &pound;1,900, the greater part of
which was distributed in coals.&nbsp; The apparatus for making
soup by steam first set up in the Bull Entry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 20&mdash;A dinner given at
the Lion Inn, Kidderminster, to the Right Hon. Earl Beauchamp, in
acknowledgment of the undeviating attention which his lordship
had uniformly paid to the interests of that town while he had
been the representative of the county.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Local Acts</span>&mdash;For better
repairing the roads leading into and from the city of Worcester;
for enlarging the powers of the acts for repairing the roads from
Bromsgrove to Dudley; for enclosing lands at Rock, Feckenham, and
Minith Wood.</p>
<h3>1817.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> distress which still continued
in the early part of this year occasioned many tumultuous
meetings in different parts of the country, and loud outcries for
Parliamentary Reform.&nbsp; The ministry, taking advantage of
some of the excesses of the populace, obtained the suspension of
the Habeas Corpus Act, and the passing of an act for repressing
&ldquo;seditious meetings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Francis
Burdett&rsquo;s motion for a committee to inquire into the state
of the representation, was negatived by 205 to 77.&nbsp; Three
per Cents. averaged 74; wheat averaged 96s. 11d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 26&mdash;Lord Deerhurst
presented the Worcester petition for Parliamentary Reform and
Retrenchment, which had been signed by 3,000 freemen and
inhabitants.&nbsp; He gave it a modified support in a maiden
speech of considerable length.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 25&mdash;A second
subscription commenced for the relief of the Worcester
poor&mdash;the &pound;1,900 subscribed in the previous November
having been all spent in coal, soup, and bread; 1,500 penny
loaves and 1,500 quarts of soup were given away daily, and 1,300
tons of <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>coal distributed.&nbsp; The second subscription
realised about &pound;300; and when the committee, at the end of
April, announced that they must discontinue giving bread with the
soup, Miss Stillingfleet of College Green requested that it might
be furnished at her expense, which was done for some time, at a
total cost to that lady of &pound;150.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 18&mdash;A person exposing
elvers for sale fined in the mitigated penalty of 10s., at the
instance of the Worcester Fisheries Association.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 24&mdash;The Hon. W. H.
Lyttelton presented a petition to the House of Commons from the
parish of Oldswinford, complaining of the pressure of the poor
rates.&nbsp; The rate there assessed on houses amounted to 29s.
in the pound; on the rent of land employed in farming, to 32s.;
and on several other kinds of land, to 61s. in the pound!&nbsp;
The population was 4,381, of whom 1,868 received parish relief,
and only 158 persons were able to contribute to the rates.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 8&mdash;An elegant silver cup
presented to Robert Felton, Esq., at a dinner at the Star and
Garter, on his leaving the neighbourhood, &ldquo;In testimony of
the admiration of the donors of his ardent devotion to the public
welfare, and of their esteem for the disinterested friendship and
generous zeal which distinguished his social
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 5&mdash;Viscount Sidmouth
visited Worcester, and was presented with the freedom of the
city.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 19&mdash;The whole of the
shops closed in Worcester during the time appointed for the
funeral of the Princess Charlotte.&nbsp; The Mayor and
Corporation attended divine service at the Cathedral, where a
pathetic discourse was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Forester, one of
the Prebendaries, from <i>Luke</i> viii, 52&mdash;&ldquo;She is
not dead, but sleepeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Local Acts</span>&mdash;For amending the
act of last session as to repairing the Worcester roads; for
enclosing lands at Cofton Hackett.</p>
<h3>1818.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Trade</span> began to revive and
agriculturists again to be hopeful&mdash;principally as the
result of the favourable exchanges bringing us large quantities
of the precious metals from the continent, which gave ease to the
banks and encouraged the liberal use of money in various
undertakings.&nbsp; Thus employment became abundant, and the
working classes were contented.&nbsp; The gradual disappearance
of the precious metals for several years past <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>had been a
source of much disquietude to our statesmen, and was no doubt one
cause of the great fall in prices which took place on the advent
of peace; but it must principally be attributed to the absence of
that demand by Government for men and money which, during the
war, was so great.&nbsp; Consols averaged 79; wheat averaged 86s.
3d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The Worcester Fire
Office dissolved in favour of the Ph&oelig;nix Fire Office.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The price of hops at
this time averaged from &pound;26 to &pound;31 per cwt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 29&mdash;At the County
Quarter Sessions, Earl Beauchamp, the chairman, severely lectured
the farmers, through the grand jury, on paying their labourers
such miserably low wages&mdash;as breaking down all independence
of spirit, and necessarily tending to the increase of crime.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 7&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">Worcester Gas Company</span> formed at a meeting
held at the Guildhall, William Wall, Esq., in the chair.&nbsp;
The share list, subscribing &pound;12,000, was filled up in a few
hours, and the shares&mdash;on the deposit of 20s.&mdash;were, in
two days, at 50s. premium.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 14&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">Worcester Savings Bank</span> established at a
meeting held at the Guildhall, with Earl Beauchamp in the
chair.&nbsp; It was opened in June, at a temporary office in
Foregate Street, and &pound;745 were paid in, in small sums, the
first day.&nbsp; It has ever since continued to be a flourishing
and most useful institution.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span>&mdash;Six men charged before
the magistrates of Worcester with garden robbing, were ordered to
be publicly whipped in the several parishes where the offences
were committed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 31&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">Worcester Society of Arts</span> exhibited their
pictures&mdash;the first exhibition of the kind in
Worcester&mdash;at the Town Hall.&nbsp; The paintings principally
consisted of landscapes by Thornycroft, Smith, Doe, and Young;
animals by Pitman; some Scripture subjects by Bacon; portraits by
Millichap; and several contributions by amateurs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 2&mdash;Twenty-seven
illegal fishing nets and three large wheels, found in use at a
mill near Worcester, were seized by order of the Worcester Severn
Association committee, and publicly burnt in the Corn Market.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 7&mdash;The Grand Duke
Michael, brother to the Emperor <a name="page248"></a><span

the purpose of inspecting porcelain manufactories, and ordered a
large service of Messrs. Chamberlain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 25&mdash;Eight men killed
by an explosion of fire-damp in the Buffery Colliery, Dudley.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 19&mdash;A bull baited on
Pitchcroft.&nbsp; The poor animal was most barbarously mangled,
and, after the &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; was driven through the
principal streets to the slaughter house, writhing in
torture.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Local Acts</span>&mdash;For lighting
Worcester and Kidderminster with gas; for enclosing lands at
Great Comberton.</p>
<h3>1819.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hopes of a speedy return to
prosperity which the previous year had excited were again
overcast, and all classes were feeling the pinchings of
distress.&nbsp; This renewed again the outcries for Parliamentary
Reform; and the people, exasperated by the stringent measures of
the ministry, began to exhibit some alarming symptoms of
discontent.&nbsp; The crowning scene was the meeting at
Manchester, and the &ldquo;Peterloo Massacre,&rdquo; which formed
an exciting topic for Parliament.&nbsp; Lord John Russell made
his first motion for Parliamentary Reform, which only amounted to
the disfranchisement of a few of the rotten boroughs, and a
transfer of their franchise to the large towns; and it was
withdrawn on the ministry promising to disfranchise Grampound,
where Sir M. M. Lopez, member for Evesham in May, 1807, had
bribed voters at &pound;35 apiece.&nbsp; But by far the most
important measure of the year was the Cash Payments Bill, which
is generally known as &ldquo;Peel&rsquo;s Bill,&rdquo; but is
rather to be ascribed to Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Ricardo.&nbsp;
This provided for a gradual return to cash payments, and the
withdrawal of all bank notes under &pound;5.&nbsp; The result of
this measure, in contracting the circulation of the country, and
in depressing prices, was far greater than had been
anticipated.&nbsp; In anticipation only of such a measure, the
circulation of the Bank of England had <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>been
reduced, since 1815, by two millions; and since 1814, two hundred
out of seven hundred country banks had entirely
disappeared.&nbsp; Three per Cents. averaged 71; wheat averaged
74s. 6d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">Worcester Humane Society</span>, which had been
first of all established in 1786, but suffered to die out,
revived, under the auspices of Lord Beauchamp.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 26&mdash;Meeting at
Stourport, the Rev. Reginald Pyndar in the chair, to protest
against any duty or tax being imposed upon coals at the
pit&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 3&mdash;A silver cup, value
100 guineas, transmitted to Sir William Duff Gordon, by those of
his former constituents who had been his supporters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 3&mdash;Two parcels, from the
bankers of Worcester to the bank of Sir William Curtis and Co.,
being incautiously left for a few minutes, by the guard of the
old Fly coach, in the bar of the Bull and Mouth, Aldersgate, were
stolen.&nbsp; They contained about &pound;4,000 in unnegociable
bills of exchange, and about a like amount in provincial and Bank
of England notes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 10&mdash;The wife of Joseph
Richardson, a day labourer, living at Cooksey, near Bromsgrove,
and in receipt of 10s. a week wages, was delivered of four
children at a birth, all of whom lived and throve heartily.&nbsp;
Being deserving people they were subsidised by many of the
neighbouring gentry, and the four children proved a pretty stroke
of fortune to them.&nbsp; A ball was given on behalf of the four
younglings at the Talbot Inn, Stourbridge; and they were all
christened at Upton Warren Church, having sixteen godfathers and
godmothers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 30&mdash;Petitions presented
from various towns in Worcestershire against a proposed New
Settlement Act, which would have given a settlement to a pauper
by three years&rsquo; residence only.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 4&mdash;The Hon W. H. Lyttelton
moved a resolution, in the House of Commons, for the abolition of
lotteries; but the Chancellor of the Exchequer thought them very
good things, and the Government could not spare the &pound;30,000
of revenue which they annually produced.&nbsp; The motion was
negatived by 133 to 84.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 9&mdash;An association formed,
at a meeting at the Crown Inn, called &ldquo;The Worcestershire
Association for the Protection of Agriculture.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Agriculture, the promoters said, ought to be the predominant
interest in the state, and they conceived that, from <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>a want of
union, they had suffered many important privileges to be wrested
from them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;T. C. Hornyold, Esq., and
F. L. Charlton, Esq., endeavoured to re&euml;stablish a pack of
fox hounds in this county, but failed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 5&mdash;The first
anniversary dinner of the Worcestershire Medical and Surgical
Society, held in Worcester.&nbsp; Dr. Hastings, president; Mr. J.
P. Sheppard, vice president; Mr. C. H. Hebb, secretary.&nbsp; The
Provincial Medical and Surgical Association may be said to have
had its origin with this society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 9&mdash;The city of
Worcester first lighted with gas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 23&mdash;The freemen of
Evesham entertained their representative, Sir Charles Cockerell,
Bart., to a dinner at the Guildhall, in commemoration of his
success in confining the franchise of the borough to the freemen
only.&nbsp; A handsome bronze medal was after dinner presented by
Sir Charles to each of the freemen present, as a mark of his
favour and esteem.</p>

strangled in bed by her husband, Joseph Waterson, a miller,
living at Bromsgrove.&nbsp; It was quite clear that the man had
been some time insane; and the coroner&rsquo;s jury returning a
verdict to that effect, he was at once removed to the Lunatic
Asylum at Droitwich.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 16&mdash;Colonel Davies moved

London Fly coach upset at Stoughton bridge on its return from
town.&nbsp; There were fourteen passengers, exclusive of the
coachman and guard, and all were hurt.&nbsp; A lady had her arm
broken; a poor woman her arm broken, and various contusions; a
gentleman had his hip dislocated, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; No

at the Rein Deer, Worcester, a petition to the King praying him
to dismiss his ministers, and a congratulatory address to the
Queen on her acquittal, were agreed on, and afterwards received
about 2,000 signatures.&nbsp; A counter address to the King, from

a licentious press, sent from Evesham and Stourbridge.&nbsp; An
address for the county was also drawn up by the Lord Lieutenant,
and being approved of by the High Sheriff was sent to the
different towns in the county for signatures, as the promoters
could not have convened a public meeting with any hope of success
to their cause.&nbsp; A counter address, headed by Lord
Foley&rsquo;s signature, was immediately got up.&nbsp; Counter
addresses sent from Droitwich, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>1821.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> low price of agricultural
produce caused such an outcry from the farmers, that a committee
was appointed on agricultural distress, whose report, however,
did not tend much to enlighten Parliament as to the means of
relieving them.&nbsp; Tenants farming with borrowed capital, and
landowners whose estates were mortgaged, must of course, the
committee said, feel heavily the increased value of money
occasioned by the recent changes in the currency; and they could
only hope for relief from a reduction of the rate of
interest&mdash;such as did actually take place shortly
afterwards.&nbsp; The Bank resumed cash payments, and called in
all its &pound;1 notes, on the 1st of May.&nbsp; The Catholic
Emancipation Bill first passed the Commons this year, by small
majorities, but was rejected by the Lords.&nbsp; Consols averaged
75; wheat averaged 56s. 1d.</p>

they said that &ldquo;the projected alteration in the laws
affecting Roman Catholics is a measure so hazardous in the
experiment as to afford just ground for alarm,&rdquo; and they
considered that &ldquo;the qualifying of Roman Catholics to
possess political power will tend to injure the Protestant
Establishment, which they are bound to transmit, unimpaired, to

in a bill for the better preventing the adulteration of clover

<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 29&mdash;The coronation of His

bakers&rsquo;, smiths&rsquo;, tailors&rsquo;, fishermen&rsquo;s,
butchers&rsquo;, carpenters&rsquo; and masons&rsquo; companies,
Druids&rsquo; Lodge, Lodge of Odd Fellows, and the Orange
Lodge.&nbsp; Festivities at Bromsgrove, Bewdley, Evesham,
Kidderminster, and Stourbridge, particularly noticeable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 27&mdash;The new tower of
St. Helen&rsquo;s Church, Worcester, completed, and the bells,
which had so long remained mute, in consequence of the
dilapidation of the old tower, were once more roused into
harmony.&nbsp; These bells were cast in 1706, and bear the names
of Queen Anne, her principal commanders and their victories.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 8&mdash;A meeting of
yeomanry, connected with the Agricultural Association, held at
the Crown Inn, Sir Thomas Winnington in the chair, at which a
series of resolutions were agreed to, tracing &ldquo;agricultural
distress&rdquo; to a depreciated paper currency, <i>doubling</i>
the prices of produce labour and rents; and while the proposed
return to the bullion standard was reducing these to their former
level, the charges to the farmholder, sinecurist, and placeman
were not reduced.&nbsp; They were also still of opinion that the
admission of foreign grain, duty free, [that is after wheat was
80s. a quarter] added grievously to the difficulties of the
landed interest.&nbsp; Mr. George Webb Hall was the chief
speaker.</p>
<p><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span><span

Bromyard roads.</p>
<h3>1822.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year commenced with the same
heavy complaints from the agriculturists, and in most counties
meetings were held to declare their distress, and to call for
retrenchment and reform.&nbsp; In some cases Mr. Cobbett procured
the addition of a rider to these agricultural petitions, praying
for a reduction of interest on the National Debt.&nbsp; Such a
reduction, indeed, was actually made, by the conversion of the
Five per Cents.; and this, with the retrenchments forced upon
ministers by the representatives of the counties constantly
voting with Mr. Hume and other economists, allowed of
considerable relief in the shape of remission of taxes.&nbsp; The
Bank of England also reduced its rate of discount from five to
four per cent. on the 20th of June.&nbsp; A most important
measure, too, was that which extended permission to the banks to
issue notes under the value of &pound;5 until 1833, which was
likewise forced upon ministers by the Parliamentary landlords;
and it produced an immediate rise in prices, but led also to a
plethora of paper money most disastrous in its
consequences.&nbsp; Consols averaged 80; wheat averaged 44s.

<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 25&mdash;A road maker at
Eckington, named Pickerill, only thirty-three years of age,
having obtained from his wife a confession of her infidelity,
mixed half an ounce of arsenic with as much sugar and ate it
before her face.&nbsp; Assistance was immediately obtained, but
he died in a few hours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 10&mdash;An attempt was
made to carry away a newly buried corpse from Grimley
churchyard.&nbsp; A reward of &pound;50 was offered for the
conviction of the resurrectionists, who had evidently only
desisted from carrying away the body by finding it too much
decomposed for their purpose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span>&mdash;The penny loaf, as
fixed by the magistrates at what was called the assize of bread,
varied from 4 oz. 14 dr. to 9 oz. 14 dr. between October, 1821,

<p><span class="smcap">Local Act</span>&mdash;For repair of

<h3>1823.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great abundance of monied

<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 13&mdash;Consecration of St.
Clement&rsquo;s New Church by the Bishop of the Diocese.&nbsp;
Sermon preached by the rector, the Rev. John Davies; and a
collection, realising &pound;95. 10s., afterwards made at the
doors&mdash;and this, with donations and collections the next
Sabbath, was increased to &pound;174. 10s.&nbsp; The church is
built in the Saxon style, and contains 807 sittings, 407 of which
are free.&nbsp; The old church was situated on this side the
river, on the North Quay.&nbsp; It was in a most dilapidated
condition, and often unapproachable in flood time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 25&mdash;Messrs. Flight,

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 31&mdash;The Worcester Paving
and Lighting Act received the royal assent&mdash;better known as
the City Commissioners&rsquo; Act.&nbsp; Its provisions it is now
unnecessary to allude to, as the Commissioners themselves are now
numbered with the things that have been.&nbsp; It is curious to
notice, however, that it took power to pull down the houses in
front of All Saints&rsquo; Church; but, after a lapse of thirty
years, this improvement was effected not by act of Parliament or
a public body, but by voluntary and private efforts.&nbsp; At
their first meeting, Mr. Welles was appointed clerk; Mr. Edward
Hooper, head surveyor; and Mr. Henry Rowe, surveyor of
buildings.&nbsp; Their first efforts were directed to the
cleansing of the streets, preventing waggons carrying
over-weights through the city, removing obstructions from the
highways, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 7&mdash;Great fight at

<h3>1824.</h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">continuous</span> advance in
prices&mdash;the result, partly of the over issue of small bank
paper, and partly of the reduction in the rate of interest, and
ease in the money market&mdash;gave the appearance of the most
unbounded prosperity to every department of business and
commerce.&nbsp; Everything that men touched turned to gold under
their hands, and the greatest wonder was felt at the sudden
disappearance of that distress which the agricultural interest,
especially, had, but a few months before, been complaining <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>of so
bitterly.&nbsp; This year the Four per Cents. were converted into
Three-and-half Stock, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was
thereby enabled still further to reduce the taxes&mdash;the

year 92.&nbsp; Wheat averaged 63s. 11d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 7&mdash;The great fight
between Spring and Langan for the championship, which is to be
found commemorated by a print hanging up in almost every inn and
public-house in England, took place in Pitchcroft, the ring being
formed just opposite to the Grand Stand.&nbsp; Considerably more
than 150 guineas were paid to the managers of the fight to ensure
its taking place at Worcester.&nbsp; The stakes were 300 guineas
a side; and the betting two to one on Spring, who was a native of
Warwickshire; while Langan was an Irishman.&nbsp; Not less than
40,000 people thronged Pitchcroft as spectators, many being
perched upon sheds and booths, erected temporarily, and let out
as standing places at considerable prices.&nbsp; During the
second round one of these erections gave way, and a number of
persons were precipitated to the ground, a distance of twenty
feet, amidst the broken timber, and trampling upon each
other.&nbsp; At least thirty people were carried to the Infirmary
with serious fractures of the limbs or ribs, and one unfortunate
fellow died of a compound fracture of the leg.&nbsp; Spring came
on the ground at half-past twelve, but Langan could not be found
for some time.&nbsp; He was, in fact, making off, and his backers
brought him back with some difficulty.&nbsp; Lord Deerhurst and
Sir James Musgrave kept time; and Colonel Berkeley acted as
umpire.&nbsp; Spring was exceedingly cautious, and Langan
impetuous, and the greater part of the rounds ended in wrestling,
in which Langan often succeeded in throwing his antagonist.&nbsp;
By the eighteenth round the ring was broken in by the crushing of
the mob, and not ten feet of space was left for the men to fight
in.&nbsp; After an hour and a half&rsquo;s fighting the affair
seemed as little near conclusion as at its commencement.&nbsp; At
the eightieth round, Langan planted a tremendous blow on
Spring&rsquo;s head; but, at the eighty-fourth, Spring knocked
Langan down with such terrific hits, that he fell as weak as a
child.&nbsp; The cry then became general to take him away, but,
although covered in his gore, he refused to give in, and was at
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>last
only removed by force.&nbsp; The battle lasted two hours and
thirty-two minutes&mdash;a most unheard of length of time.&nbsp;
At the next assizes Mr. Justice Park, in his charge to the grand
jury, administered a severe rebuke to the county and city
magistracy for winking at, and permitting, this affair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 6&mdash;James Jones and John
Brown were publicly whipped in front of the County Gaol (in
addition to three months&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour),
for stealing an old tea kettle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span>&mdash;The proposition to
admit the importation of French gloves, hitherto altogether
prohibited, created great consternation amongst the manufacturers
at Worcester.&nbsp; Mr. Huskisson, in replying to some questions
of Colonel Davies about the matter, in the House,
said&mdash;&ldquo;He trusted to the eloquence of the gallant
Colonel for satisfying his constituents of the reasonableness of
those views of open trade in which he had the honour to agree
with the gallant Colonel.&nbsp; As to the particular article of
gloves, there must be time to determine what proportion of duty
they were to bear.&nbsp; The prohibitions, however, must be done
away, and a high protecting duty substituted.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
duty was afterwards fixed at 4s. per doz. on habits, 5s. on
men&rsquo;s, and 7s. on women&rsquo;s gloves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 17&mdash;Mrs. Fry attended
the quarterly meeting of the Friends in Worcester, and addressed
the congregation who were assembled at their Meeting House.&nbsp;
She afterwards visited both City and County Prisons with Samuel
Gurney, and at the latter addressed the prisoners in plain and
forcible language.</p>

<h3>1825.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> in so short a period of time
did a nation experience such a transition from the confidence of
commercial prosperity, to the despair and panic of general
bankruptcy, as did Britain in the twelve months of 1825.&nbsp;
The year opened with a flow of trade and ease in making money
which had never been equalled, and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer declared that the prosperity of the country was fixed
on a firm and immutable basis&mdash;for which speech, Mr. Cobbett
nicknamed him Mr. Prosperity Robinson.&nbsp; Yet before the year
closed all was in confusion: a run upon all the banks throughout
the kingdom took place&mdash;seventy three country banks were
totally insolvent&mdash;the Bank of England itself was only saved
from a complete drain of its gold, which was reduced to under
&pound;1,300,000, by the fortunate discovery of a box of one
pound notes&mdash;bankruptcy and ruin spread amongst traders of
every class&mdash;and the country was within forty-eight hours of
barter.&nbsp; To account for this disastrous state of things is
not difficult.&nbsp; The enhancement of prices, and the
recklessness of the country bankers in pushing their paper money,
had begot a spirit of speculation and gambling, not equalled
since the South Sea Bubble.&nbsp; Between 1822 and 1825,
twenty-six foreign loans were negociated, of which only ten are
now paying dividends; and companies were started for all
imaginable purposes, the nominal capital of which amounted in the
whole to more than four hundred millions sterling.&nbsp; Soon
after midsummer, this year, the tables began to
turn&mdash;foreign <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>markets were glutted with British fabrics, and a drain
of gold took place to pay for the imports, as foreigners would no
longer take our goods.&nbsp; Besides this, gold and silver coin
chained down to a certain standard of value, while all other
things had enormously risen in price, was of course a profitable
speculation for the foreigners; and in 1822&ndash;3 and 4,
thirty-three millions and a half of ounces of silver were
exported, and the known export of gold exceeded 1,270,000
ounces.&nbsp; It will be seen that, to the credit of this county,
not a single bank here was actually insolvent, and only one
closed its doors even for a short period.&nbsp; Three per Cents.

<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 25&mdash;The lady of Sir
Edward Mostyn, Bart., then residing at Spring Bank, Red Hill,
near Worcester, was returning home in her carriage, when the
horses took fright and set off at a gallop.&nbsp; She jumped out,
and received such severe contusions on the head that she died in
two days afterwards.&nbsp; Her remains were interred in the
parish church of Llannas, Flintshire, in which county Talacre,
Sir Edward&rsquo;s paternal seat, was situated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span>&mdash;The long brass
French six-pounder and nine suits of black armour which now adorn
the walls of the lower hall, in the Guildhall, Worcester,

after the fatal battle of 1651.</p>

<p>To prevent the occurrence of such dire disasters as the
previous year had witnessed, a bill was brought in the moment
Parliament met, to prohibit the English banks from circulating
notes under &pound;5, after February, 1829&mdash;thus allowing
them three years to recall their present issue.&nbsp; The loss by
the panic of the previous December is estimated at
&pound;40,000,000 sterling; but matters soon began to right
themselves, and the elasticity of British resources never was
more signally displayed.&nbsp; At Midsummer a dissolution took
place, the Parliament having sat for nearly seven years.&nbsp;
The questions which principally agitated the public mind were the
Corn Laws and Catholic Emancipation.&nbsp; The Corn Law of 1815
had dissatisfied all parties, and the populace generally
entertained the greatest hostility to it.&nbsp; In Ireland the
priests now first openly interfered in the elections to procure
the return of members pledged to the Catholic cause; while in
England a strong counter feeling was evoked, and in many places
Whig candidates were rejected, in spite of family influence,
because of their leaning towards Catholic Emancipation.&nbsp; The
<a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>harvest
being a failure, as regarded oats and rye, peas and beans, the
Government issued an Order in Council to admit these kinds of
food at a duty of 2s. a quarter; and Parliament was called
together in November to pass an Act of Indemnity.&nbsp; Three per

<p><span class="smcap">February</span>&mdash;The glovemakers of
Worcester made several ineffectual remonstrances against the
proposed alteration of the laws touching the admission of foreign
manufactured articles.&nbsp; They were told that gloves would
certainly be admitted in the ensuing July, though with the
protective duties already mentioned.&nbsp; These being considered
insufficient, the trade was brought to an entire
stand-still.&nbsp; By the exertions of Colonel Davies, however,
the importation was limited to the port of London only, and
confidence was gradually restored to the business.</p>

consisting of the two sons and four daughters of Mr. Joseph Hill,
farmer, of Lintridge, near Dymock, and Miss Helen Woodyatt,
daughter of a Hereford confectioner, ascended Malvern Hills, and
being overtaken by a thunderstorm, took refuge in an alcove, on
the Worcestershire Beacon, which was roofed with iron.&nbsp; This
attracted the electric fluid, and in one discharge of lightning
the whole party were laid prostrate on the ground: three of the
Misses Hill and Miss Woodyatt were killed, and the others were
seriously injured.</p>

<h3>1827.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the elections had caused
considerable change in the constitution of the House of Commons
was made apparent by their coming, early in the session, to a
vote adverse to the Catholic claims&mdash;the votes of the Lower
House on this question having for many years past been favourable
to their consideration.&nbsp; A motion of Sir Francis Burdett to
remove penalties from the Catholics, though warmly supported by
Mr. Canning, was lost by 276 votes to 272.&nbsp; Lord
Liverpool&rsquo;s illness requiring the reorganisation of the
cabinet, so much difficulty was experienced in the choice of a
prime minister that the country was virtually without a ministry
for some weeks.&nbsp; The Catholic question was put forward as
the principal difficulty&mdash;the chief members of Lord
Liverpool&rsquo;s administration refusing to take office under a
Premier who was favourable to the Catholic claims.&nbsp;
Immediately that Mr. Canning&mdash;whose talents unequivocally
marked him out for the position&mdash;kissed hands, the Duke of
Wellington, Lord Eldon, Mr. Peel, and others of the old cabinet
resigned, and Mr. Canning could only hold office by an
unprincipled coalition with the Whigs&mdash;unprincipled because
such a ministry could only be carried on by one party or the
other totally belieing their previous political creed.&nbsp; Mr.
Canning had always avowed himself the determined foe of
Parliamentary Reform and the repeal of the Test Acts, but was
popular because of his adhesion to the Catholic claims and the
policy he <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>had adopted as Foreign Secretary&mdash;separating this
country from the Holy Alliance, recognising the South American
States, and interfering in defence of the independence of
Portugal.&nbsp; Earl Grey was the only member of the Whig party
who openly and honestly stood aloof from the new ministry.&nbsp;
Immediately after the close of the session, Mr.
Canning&mdash;irritated, perplexed, exhausted, by the forsaking
of all his former friends&mdash;died.&nbsp; The new ministry was
then reorganised under the leadership of Viscount
Goderich&mdash;formerly Mr. Robinson.&nbsp; Three per Cents.

<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The celebrated
&ldquo;Horace Bentley&rdquo; controversy originated in a
paragraph which appeared this month in <i>Berrow&rsquo;s
Worcester Journal</i>, stating that the Roman Catholics in Cavan,
Ireland, were renouncing the errors of their Church in
considerable numbers.&nbsp; In the <i>Journal</i> of February 7,
a person signing the initials &ldquo;W. L.&rdquo; begged, as an
English Catholic, to be informed what were the errors that the
Catholics of Cavan were renouncing, and pledged himself that, if
any one would point out to him only one error, either in morals
or doctrine, which the Catholic Church taught, he would, as soon
as possible after, publicly read his recantation in the parish
church of B&mdash;.&nbsp; In a fortnight after W. L.&rsquo;s
letter had appeared, one was inserted in reply, signed
&ldquo;Horace Bentley,&rdquo; offering, if the Bible was accepted
as the test, to prove that the Church of Rome taught
&ldquo;several fundamental and fatal errors.&rdquo;&nbsp; W. L.
replied that he would &ldquo;leave Mr. B. to take his own
course.&nbsp; He might prove his allegations from the Holy
Scriptures, or from any source he might deem expedient&mdash;he
was ready to join the issue with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, Horace
Bentley contended, was an evasion of the requirement&mdash;that
an absolute test of truth and error should be agreed upon; but,
nevertheless, proceeded to prove the existence of what are
considered by Protestants to be the principal errors of the Roman
Church, by an extraordinary array of quotations from Catholic
authors and authorities themselves.&nbsp; The letters were, on
all hands, admitted to display singular ability.&nbsp; W. L., at
first, questioned the correctness of the quotations, and was
evidently astonished at their production.&nbsp; An offer was made
by the Catholic party to change their champion, on the ground of
W. L.&rsquo;s incompetence; and, <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>though this was not accepted, yet
the last two letters under that signature were plainly from
another hand.&nbsp; In these, endeavour was made to show that the
doctrines of the Church of England were, in many respects,
identical with those of the Church of Rome, and that &ldquo;every
consistent Protestant must be an infidel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Protestant party were so delighted with their disputant, that a
proposal was made to purchase a piece of plate by
subscription.&nbsp; The <i>incognito</i> was, for a long time,
most admirably preserved, and the letters of Horace Bentley were
pretty generally ascribed to the Rev. Dr. Hook, then Dean of
Worcester.&nbsp; It has now, however, long been known that they
were written by the Rev. G. Redford, D.D., LL.D., minister at
Angel Street Chapel, Worcester.&nbsp; The original W. L. was a
machine manufacturer at Bromsgrove.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 3&mdash;A duel took place on
Kempsey Ham between John Somerset Russell, Esq., of Powick Court,
and Mr. John Parker, master of the Worcestershire Fox
Hounds.&nbsp; They fired at each other, but neither of the balls
took effect; and the seconds then interfered and effected a
reconciliation.&nbsp; An officer came on the ground, armed with a
warrant, to arrest the disputants, but of course he was
&ldquo;too late.&rdquo;&nbsp; The quarrel arose about some matter
connected with the hunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 27&mdash;Colonel Davies voted
in a minority of nineteen on an amendment, moved by Mr. Hume, to
admit wheat at all times at a fixed duty of 10s. a quarter.&nbsp;
Colonel Davies also succeeded in obtaining the appointment of a
committee to inquire into the mode of taking the poll at
elections for cities and boroughs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span>&mdash;An eccentric fellow at
Droitwich cut his throat, having previously left some most
singular instructions respecting his funeral, which were obeyed
to the letter.&nbsp; He was buried with his shoes on, with a
penny in one hand and a halfpenny in the other.&nbsp; Some of the
earth surrounding his mother&rsquo;s coffin was put into his, and
his body was wrapped in the sheet on which she had been laid
out.&nbsp; The carriers of the coffin and mourners ran, as soon
as the funeral was over, at their topmost speed, to a public
house, where they sang <i>one</i> song and <i>two</i> psalms,
afterwards drinking peace to the soul of the departed till they
were all drunk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 29&mdash;At a meeting of the
Worcester Corporation, on the motion of Henry Clifton, Esq., the
freedom of the city was unanimously voted to the Right Hon.

<p><span class="smcap">December</span>&mdash;The Worcestershire
Yeomanry disbanded by order of Government, in common with all
those corps which had not been engaged in actual service of any
kind for the previous ten years.&nbsp; The regiment was first
raised in 1794, by the Hon. Somers Cocks.&nbsp; The Kidderminster
troop, which was a separate body, raised in 1798 and commanded by
Captain Boycot, was also disbanded.</p>
<h3>1828.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> discordant materials of which
the Canning ministry was composed after his death, soon brought
it to an end: before Parliament met this year Lord Goderich had
resigned, and the Wellington and Peel cabinet was formed.&nbsp;
The most important measure of the year was the repeal of the Test
and Corporation Acts; the principle of which having been affirmed
in the House of Commons, on the motion of Lord John Russell, by a
majority of 237 to 193, was adopted by the Government, and they
carried through the bill as their own measure.&nbsp; Consols

<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 1&mdash;The tolls on
carriages and horsemen passing over Worcester bridge
discontinued&mdash;the bridge having been erected forty-six
years, and the trustees having now paid off the debt, and laid by
a fund yielding a revenue of &pound;125 a year to be applied in
the repairs of the bridge and its approaches.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 3&mdash;Holt Fleet bridge
opened to the public.&nbsp; Its extreme length is 226 feet, and
consists of one arch of 150 feet span; the centre being 35 feet
above the river at ordinary periods.&nbsp; The design was
furnished by Telford.&nbsp; The entire cost was &pound;8,300.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 26&mdash;Four elegant
silver corner dishes and covers, weighing nearly 300 ounces,
presented to the Rev. George Turberville of Hanley Castle, for
his long and valuable services as an active magistrate of the
county.&nbsp; The presentation took place at a <a

the White Lion, Upton, at which Sir Anthony Lechmere, Bart.,
presided.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 3&mdash;The Rev. Mr.
Ketley, appointed by the London Missionary Society to take the
place of the ill-treated Smith, of Demerara, whose case had
occupied so large a share of public attention, was publicly
ordained at the Independent Chapel, Worcester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 26&mdash;A sumptuous

&ldquo;as a farewell token of the cordial and lasting esteem

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 29&mdash;The inhabitants of
Bewdley, following <i>suite</i> with the Kentish Brunswickers on
Penenden Heath, declared in public meeting that &ldquo;the
Protestant constitution shall not be changed.&rdquo;&nbsp; John
Williams, Esq., the High Bailiff, was in the chair; and the
petition against the Catholic claims was moved by the Rev. John
Cawood, and seconded by John Nichols, Esq.&nbsp; There was no
opposition.&nbsp; The Mayor and Corporation of Evesham forwarded
a similar petition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ministry&mdash;supposed by all
England to be determined to resist, <i>a l&rsquo;outrance</i>,
the claims of the Catholics to emancipation&mdash;astounded the
country by making the King recommend, in his speech at the
opening of Parliament, that these claims should be immediately
taken into consideration.&nbsp; The Catholic Association and Mr.
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s election for Clare were supposed to have
been the causes immediately compelling ministers to give way; but
the Emancipation Act really owed its existence to the continuous
efforts of the great Liberal party and the weight of public
opinion in England.&nbsp; The measure was passed in the Commons
by a majority of 173, and in the Lords of 105.&nbsp; The
circulation of small notes came to an end in the early part of
this year, and although so much time had been afforded for
preparation for this step, and it had been so repeatedly
postponed, it nevertheless produced much straitness in commercial
transactions, and had its effect in reducing both the price of
the provisions and the wages of labour.&nbsp; Three per Cents.

received about 6,000 signatures in this county.&nbsp; On the
presentation of the petition in the House of Lords, Lord
Lyttelton characterised the manner in which it was got up as
&ldquo;anomalous and irregular.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 9&mdash;The <span

<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 17&mdash;An alarming fire
in the outbuildings of Mr. Joseph Ross of Sneachill, White Lady

incendiary, no doubt being entertained that it was wilful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 24&mdash;Meeting of the
clergy of the diocese, with Archdeacon Onslow in the chair, to

<p><span class="smcap">Ministers</span>, having alienated their
old friends by their conduct on the Catholic question, held
office by support of the Whigs, but towards the close of the
session these also deserted them.&nbsp; The revolutions at Paris
and Brussels, the demise of George IV, and the distress amongst
the agricultural labourers giving rise to fearful incendiarism
through the whole of the south of England, imparted extraordinary
interest and importance to the question of Parliamentary
Reform.&nbsp; Public meetings were everywhere held upon the
subject, and at the elections which took place in August,
Reformers were returned for all those towns where the
constituency was at all on a popular basis.&nbsp; The result was
a loss of more than fifty members to ministers; and they managed
to involve themselves in still more unpopularity and dislike by
their unqualified declarations against all Reform, and by
dissuading the King from accepting an invitation to dine at
Guildhall on Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day, on the ground of apprehended
disturbance.&nbsp; The new Parliament met on the 2nd of November,
and on the 15th Sir Henry Parnell moved for a committee to revise
the civil list.&nbsp; A division took place, and ministers were
left in a minority of 29&mdash;233 votes being given for the
motion, and 204 against it.&nbsp; Ministers immediately resigned,
and Earl Grey was called to His Majesty&rsquo;s Councils, with
the understanding that Parliamentary Reform was to be a cabinet
measure.&nbsp; Thus, after twenty-three years&rsquo; exclusion
from office, the Whigs found themselves in power, and their
principles triumphant.&nbsp; Consols averaged 98&frac12;; wheat

&ldquo;Society of Workmen,&rdquo; attacked, almost without
notice, the factory of Mr. Cooper, because he employed a number
of men upon a particular description of light work at three
halfpence per yard less than the customary price.&nbsp; In the
evening the mob again assembled, and broke the windows not only
of Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s house, but those of Mr. Simcox Lea, Mr.
Best, Mr. Brinton, Mr. Dobson, and Mr. Gough, manufacturers; of
George Constance, Esq., High Bailiff; Messrs. Hallen and Talbot,
solicitors; Mr. Boycot; Mr. Russell, coal merchant; the Town

twelve years of age, displayed the greatest interest in the
ingenious processes to which the porcelain clay is submitted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 18&mdash;Frightful

the drag on the wheel in coming down Severn Stoke hill, and the
speed which the vehicle gained as it came down, upset it shortly
after rounding the turn at the bottom.&nbsp; Mr. Bennett,
organist of Christ Church, Oxford, was killed on the spot; and
Mr. Hughes, glover, of Sidbury, Worcester, died next

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> measure of Reform, introduced
by the Grey ministry a few days after the meeting of Parliament,
so much exceeded general expectation in extent and boldness, that
the people immediately adopted it with enthusiasm; and the cry
was, &ldquo;The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the
Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a debate of seven nights&rsquo;
duration, leave was given to bring it in <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>without a
division, and the trial of strength was reserved for the second
reading, which was carried by a majority of one only; the numbers
being&mdash;for, 302; against, 301.&nbsp; The ministers, however,
persevered with it; but, in committee, General Gascoyne moved
that the number of members for England and Wales should not be
diminished, and this was carried against ministers by a majority
of eight.&nbsp; The consequence was, that the bill was for a
while abandoned, and another appeal made to the country.&nbsp;
The elections, which now took place in the midst of unparalleled
excitement, gave ministers such a decided majority in the
Commons, that the second reading of the bill was carried by a
majority of 136, and it went through committee without any
material alteration.&nbsp; The Lords, however, had not the
prudence quietly to pass a measure which the people had so
unequivocally demanded, and the second reading was negatived in
the Upper House by a majority of 41.&nbsp; Riots and disturbances
everywhere ensued; and none can understand, except those who
actually took part in the year&rsquo;s events, how near the
nation was to convulsion and revolution.&nbsp; The cholera made
its appearance in the country on the 26th October, and was very
fatal in many places.&nbsp; Consols averaged 81; wheat averaged

Chancellor gave his decision in the case of the St.

leases which had been granted by the governors were illegal, and
must be set aside.&nbsp; This decision affected large properties
in the Tything, which, having been held for leases of forty years
at a nominal rent, and these renewed at a fine only amounting to
about one year&rsquo;s rent, had been treated in the market as
little inferior to freehold.&nbsp; The proceedings were based on
an act passed at the instance of the celebrated Dr. Fell, Bishop
of Oxford in 1660, and who was then master of this
hospital.&nbsp; This act expressly provided that, in the leases
granted of the property <a name="page273"></a><span

quiet were not caught.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 9&mdash;The Kidderminster

division on the Reform Bill, on Sir R. Vyvyan&rsquo;s amendment,
&ldquo;That the Bill be read a second time that day six

present.&nbsp; The Hon. T. H. Foley, Colonel Davies, Mr.
Robinson, Mr. J. H. H. Foley, and Earl of Sefton voted against
the amendment; and Hon. H. B. Lygon and W. A. Robarts, Esq., for
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span>&mdash;The Worcester Militia

Chandos&rsquo;s celebrated amendment to the Reform Bill, giving
farming tenants at will, to the amount of not less than
&pound;50, votes for counties, Colonel Davies and Mr. Robinson
voted in the majority against ministers, and the Hon. T. H.
Foley, Captain Spencer, and Mr. Godson in the minority for
them.&nbsp; Colonel Davies, in the progress of the bill, moved
several amendments, which were discussed at length, and only
defeated by small majorities: one was to prevent persons, having
votes in boroughs, from voting at county elections.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 14&mdash;Presentation of

Hewell, the Countess of Plymouth presenting the cornets with the

given on the ground, by the Earl of Plymouth, to the nobility of
the county and officers of the regiment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 19&mdash;The Worcester

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 5&mdash;Worcester
Riots.&mdash;The ferment which the rejection <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>of the
Reform Bill by the Lords had created having spread generally
through the country, and much terror caused by the Bristol
anti-Wetherell riots, the Mayor and magistrates of Worcester
swore in a number of special constables this week; and, at the
request of the Mayor, the Home Secretary directed a troop of the
7th Hussars to take up their quarters at Droitwich.&nbsp; It was
thought possible that the ill disposed might make the county
Reform meeting, held this day, a <i>point d&rsquo;appui</i>, and
the 400 special constables had express orders to hold themselves
in readiness for action at any moment.&nbsp; However, the
proceedings passed off very quietly, and the day closed without
any disturbance; but unfortunately a small and purely accidental
fire broke out in the back premises of Mr. Woakes in High
Street.&nbsp; A great number of people were gathered to the spot,
and a squabble occurred in the crowd, during which the hose of
the fire engines was cut, and the mob seemed to regard this as
the signal for disorder.&nbsp; Some rascals harked them on to
mischief, and they first of all made an incursion into Foregate
Street, where they broke all the windows in the house of Mr.
France, solicitor, and on their return smashed those of Sir
Anthony Lechmere and other individuals known to belong to the
unpopular party.&nbsp; The Mayor and magistrates were already at
the Hall, with a large body of special constables, and the bells
of the city churches were set tolling to collect the
remainder.&nbsp; This roused the whole town, and all the bad
characters it contained were speedily enrolled amongst the
mob.&nbsp; The special constables at the command of the Mayor
sallied out of the Town Hall and engaged the rioters, and some
smartish encounters took place in various directions.&nbsp;
Several of the mob were captured and carried off to prison; but
none of the specials were much hurt.&nbsp; The tumult still
continuing, the Mayor sent off expresses to Pershore and
Droitwich for the military; but, in the interim, he addressed the
rioters, and attempted to induce them to disperse.&nbsp; Some of
the leaders said they would do so if he would release the
prisoners who had been taken.&nbsp; The Mayor, hereupon, went
down to the gaol, and, amidst the huzzas of the mob, liberated
the captives; but they then wanted the release of the other
prisoners confined in the gaol.&nbsp; This the Mayor positively
refused, and returned to the Guildhall.&nbsp; At a quarter after
one Captain Bathurst, with a troop of the 7th Hussars, rode up to
the Guildhall, and the mob threw some stones at them; and, as
they showed no disposition to disperse, the Mayor read the Riot
Act, but had no sooner done so than a stone was hurled at him,
which struck him on the <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>head.&nbsp; He immediately ordered
the military to clear the streets, which they did in a very short
time.&nbsp; A great number of stones were thrown at them; but the
resistance speedily ceased, and many parties were again taken
into custody and conveyed to the gaol.&nbsp; Several of the mob
were cut, though not seriously, by the sabres of the
military.&nbsp; A detachment of the 91st Infantry arrived from
Pershore about three a.m., but their services were not then
required.&nbsp; The city, for two or three nights afterwards,
wore an unquiet aspect, and desultory mobs were collected, but no
further harm was done.&nbsp; The magistrates examined the
prisoners afterwards&mdash;amounting, in all, to about thirty
persons.&nbsp; Most of them were liberated on entering into their
own recognizances to keep the peace, and a few of the worst were
fined or sent to the treadmill.</p>

<h3>1832.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ministers, calling Parliament
together again almost immediately, proposed another Reform Bill,
differing from the former one in the apportionment of boroughs in
the schedules, in preserving the rights of freemen by birth and
servitude, and in giving freeholders in boroughs the right to
vote in county elections.&nbsp; The second reading was carried,
on the morning of Sunday, the 18th of December, 1851, by a
majority of 324 to 162; the majority being thus much larger than
before.&nbsp; The bill passed a second reading in the Lords by a
majority of 9; seventeen peers who voted against the bill in 1831
voted for it in 1832, and others absented themselves.&nbsp;
Immediately on going into committee, however, Lord Lyndhurst
proposed to postpone the disenfranchising to the enfranchising
clauses, and this was carried against ministers by a majority of
35.&nbsp; Earl Grey then applied to the King for powers to carry
the bill as it stood; and, on the King&rsquo;s refusing a
<i>carte blanche</i> for the creation of peers, <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>ministers
resigned <i>en masse</i>.&nbsp; Lord Lyndhurst was sent for by
the King; but the Commons pledged themselves, by an overwhelming
majority, to support only the former ministers, and, in the face
of such a resolution, no ministry could be formed.&nbsp; Then
came the thunders of the <i>Times</i>, declaring that &ldquo;the
Queen had done it all,&rdquo; the threatened run upon the Bank,
and symptoms of disaffection among the soldiery.&nbsp; At last
the King found himself obliged to put into Earl Grey&rsquo;s
hands all the powers he required, and he returned to office on
the 15th of April.&nbsp; The opposition peers then, at the
King&rsquo;s request, absented themselves from the House, and the
bill passed with little further discussion.&nbsp; It received the
royal assent on the 7th of June.&nbsp; Parliament was soon
afterwards dissolved; and the new constituencies, of course,
returned a very large preponderance of Whig or Reform
members.&nbsp; Three per Cents. averaged 83&frac12;; wheat

<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;Several attempts made
to fire carpet manufactories in Kidderminster.&nbsp; The trade of
the town in a deplorable condition; 779 heads of families
receiving out-door relief weekly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 1&mdash;Colonel Davies
moved, in the House of Commons, for a committee of inquiry on the
glove trade.&nbsp; He stated that not one-third of the number of
gloves were made in Worcester that there were formerly, when 120
masters each manufactured 100 dozen a week.&nbsp; He attributed
this distress and loss of trade entirely to the free trade in
French gloves.&nbsp; Mr. Poulett Thomson contended, on behalf of
Government, that the general manufacture of gloves in this
country had increased, for the kid skins imported in the last
five years had been 3,679,000, to 2,600,000 in the five years
prior to the duty being taken off gloves.&nbsp; The distress he
believed to be owing to the late increase in the importation of
skins, to the use of Berlin gloves instead of kid, and to
overtrading.&nbsp; The numbers were&mdash;against the committee,
223; for it, 168: majority against the motion, 55.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 28&mdash;A petition from

praying that the &ldquo;system, falsely called <a

trade,&rdquo; may be abandoned, forwarded to the Earl of Coventry
for presentation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 2&mdash;The freedom of the
city presented to the Earl of Plymouth and Lieutenant Colonel
Elrington by the hand of the recorder, the Earl of
Coventry.&nbsp; To the former, principally in approval of his
raising the Yeomanry corps; and to the latter, for his public
services in the east.&nbsp; Colonel Elrington presented the
Corporation with arms and armour, taken by him from pirates in
the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 5&mdash;At a dinner given at
the Guildhall, Dr. Malden in the chair, a very handsome service
of plate was presented to the Mayor, Henry Clifton, Esq., in
remembrance of the vigilance and energy he had shown in
repressing the Worcester riots.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 17&mdash;On the memorable
second reading of the Reform Bill in the House of Lords, by a
majority of nine, the Earl of Coventry, Lord Northwick (both of
whom had voted against the former bill), Earl Somers, Lord Foley,
Lord Lyttelton, and the Bishop of Worcester voted in its favour;
and Earls Plymouth and Beauchamp and the Bishop of Rochester
against it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 23&mdash;The Mayor of
Worcester, Henry Clifton, Esq., was presented at

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 29&mdash;The trade on the
Severn stopped by the general resistance of the bow-halliers to
the use of horses in towing barges up the river.&nbsp; They
nailed the gates up along the towing path, and assembled in great
numbers to prevent any horses being attached to the
vessels.&nbsp; The magistrates made several attempts to convince
them of the unreasonableness and folly of their proceedings, but
to no purpose.&nbsp; At last the Riot Act was read, and a troop
of Scotch Greys marched into Worcester from Kidderminster.&nbsp;
Under this escort the gates were opened and several vessels taken
up the river, but not without determined opposition and much
disturbance.&nbsp; Eight men were committed for trial to the
sessions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 11 <span

Political Union, with a great number of lodges and friendly

evening dined at various public houses.&nbsp; On the Tuesday
evening the city was illuminated&mdash;the lighting up being
almost universal, and costly transparencies and devices in many
instances adopted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 14&mdash;The cholera first
made its appearance in Worcester: most of the cases occurring in
the Pinch, at the back of Bridge Place, Hylton Street, a most
dirty and close locality.&nbsp; It continued to rage till the
middle of October: 293 cases having occurred in the whole; and
the deaths amounted to 79.&nbsp; The medical men, forming the
Board of Health, had been most indefatigable in their labours and
attentions to the sick in the Cholera Hospital at Henwick.&nbsp;
A very handsome subscription was entered into for the relief of
cholera sufferers and their families, and the proceeds of a
collection after a sermon by the Rev. Canon Benson, and of a
concert at the College Hall (&pound;156), were devoted to the
same good object.&nbsp; The cholera visited every town in the
county with more or less severity.&nbsp; It raged most fearfully
at Droitwich, Redditch, and Dudley; the cases in the latter town
amounting to 1,132, with a proportion of 250 deaths.&nbsp; Warm
salt baths were found very beneficial at Droitwich.&nbsp; The
Yeomanry, this year, assembled at Warwick, because of the
prevalence of the disease in Worcester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 19&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">Provincial Medical and Surgical Association</span>
formed, at a meeting held in the board room of the Worcester
Infirmary.&nbsp; More than fifty medical men were present; and
the venerable Dr. Johnstone, of Birmingham, was called to the
chair.&nbsp; The opening address was read by Dr. Hastings, the
founder of the association; another on the objects and modes of
medical investigation by Dr. Barlow; with various medical papers
by Dr. Milligan, Dr. Malden, Dr. Jeffery, and others; with
&ldquo;A proposal to establish County Natural History

Tuesday evening, and a ball on Wednesday evening.&nbsp; The
result was highly satisfactory.&nbsp; The receipts were&mdash;for
tickets, &pound;853; collections, &pound;209; donations,
&pound;180: total, &pound;1,242.&nbsp; The expenses amounted to
&pound;792, and &pound;450 was thus left as a balance in favour
of the charity.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span><span
class="smcap">October</span> 27&mdash;The revising barristers
having completed the inquiry into the first registration of the
voters of the city of Worcester under the Reform Act, there were
left upon the list 1,521 freemen and 721 &pound;10 householders
in addition, making a total of 2,242.&nbsp; Under the old state
of things there were about 1,600 resident and 800 non-resident
freemen, so that the Reform Act somewhat lessened the number of
voters.&nbsp; It was stated, incidentally, that from the year
1760 to 1832 (seventy-two years) the Corporation of Worcester had
admitted 5,092 freemen&mdash;viz., 2,625 by right of servitude,
1,222 by birth, 1,103 by purchase, and 142 had been honorarily
admitted.&nbsp; The constituency of the county, after revision of
the lists, amounted to 8,283&mdash;viz. 3,122 for the western and
5,161 for the eastern division.&nbsp; Total population,
110,348.&nbsp; The voters for the city and various boroughs
numbered 4,235.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 5&mdash;The Duchess of
Kent and Princess Victoria passed through the county, escorted by
the Worcestershire Yeomanry, who in reward for this service have
since received the appellation of the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
Own.&rdquo;&nbsp; The royal party passed through Tenbury, Witley,
Worcester, and Bromsgrove to Hewell, where they stayed for the
night, being welcomed at each of these places with the utmost
loyalty and enthusiasm.&nbsp; At Hewell, the townspeople of
Bromsgrove and Redditch presented addresses, and the nobility of
the county assembled in the evening to pay their respects to
their Royal Highnesses.</p>
<h3>1833.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Measures</span> called for by the state of
Ireland occupied the first session of the Reformed
Parliament.&nbsp; The Coercion Bill, for the repression of crime,
was easily passed, and then came the Irish Church Bill, to
abolish the Church cess or rate, in that country, to impose a
graduated tax on clergymen, instead of taking first-fruits, and
to abolish ten out of twenty-two bishoprics.&nbsp; The bill
passed with little opposition; but a most important alteration
was made in the Lords, as to the appropriation of the revenues of
the suppressed sees.&nbsp; A motion, made in the Commons, for a
repeal of half the Malt Tax, was carried by 162 to 152; but
ministers, a few days afterwards, got the vote rescinded.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 26&mdash;Mr. G. R. Robinson
moved for a committee to revise the taxation of the country, and
to inquire into the propriety of substituting a property tax in
lieu of a great portion of it.&nbsp; The motion was defeated by
the opposition of Government: 155 members, however, voted in its
favour; amongst the minority being the Hon. H. B. Lygon and Sir
Thomas Winnington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 17&mdash;On Mr. W.

off in favour of the motion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 6&mdash;Colonel Davies moved a

of Plymouth, in Tardebigg Church.&nbsp; The whole of the Yeomanry
were assembled on the occasion, and great crowds gathered to
witness the procession.&nbsp; The burial service was performed by
the Lord Bishop of Worcester, assisted by the vicar of Tardebigg,
the Right Hon. and Rev. Lord Aston.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 9&mdash;The Government
Commissioners made their inquiries at Worcester into the Charter
and Corporation of the city.&nbsp; The forty-eight members of the
old Corporation were, of course, self-elected, and the nomination
virtually rested with a few of the body.&nbsp; They rigidly
excluded all professional men and all Dissenters.&nbsp; The
income of the body was stated to the Commissioners to be
&pound;2,100 per annum, and the expenditure about &pound;2,000;
this included subscriptions and donations for charitable
purposes, amounting to about &pound;300 a year.&nbsp; It was
accidentally discovered, during the inquiry, that the sword
bearer charged one penny per pot on all fruit brought into the
market, though the toll was only one farthing.&nbsp; A complaint
was made that the &pound;20 charged upon persons, not freemen,
who wished to trade within the limits of the city, had <a

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 25&mdash;A prisoner, named
M&lsquo;Kenzie, confined in the City Gaol for robbery, made his
escape&mdash;slipping out of his cell just as the turnkey was
locking up.&nbsp; He had to make a jump of eleven feet from the
top of one building to another; and he afterwards said that,
before making it, his courage failed him, so he knelt down and
asked God to assist him, and, by God&rsquo;s help, he
succeeded!&nbsp; A truly curious instance of superstitious
profanity.&nbsp; He was retaken at Bridgnorth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 14&mdash;Mr. Cockburn, the
Government Commissioner for inquiring into Municipal
Corporations, attended at Bewdley.&nbsp; The burgesses and
capital burgesses of the borough were all elected, or chosen by
the Corporation, and, before the passing of the Reform Act, the
privilege of voting was thus confined to some thirty or forty
persons.&nbsp; Previous to Mr. Robarts being elected the member,
it was customary for the candidate who found favour to give some
&pound;300 or &pound;400, and then there never was any opposition
to his taking his seat.&nbsp; It was said that these
&ldquo;compliments&rdquo; had always been applied to public
purposes.&nbsp; Fifty guineas were allowed annually, out of the
Corporation funds, for the bailiff&rsquo;s feast.&nbsp; No
satisfactory account was rendered of the Corporation property and
receipts; and the corporate officers refused to answer any
questions about the Bridge Trust, or the tolls taken
thereat.&nbsp; The toll on foot passengers, it appeared, had been
discontinued for eighteen years; but &pound;400 a year was raised
from the toll on carriages and horses.</p>

slavery ceased to disgrace the British colonies.&nbsp; The Irish
Church continued <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>to be the principal subject of discussion in
Parliament; and on the 27th of May, Mr. Ward moved that the
temporalities of that church ought to be reduced; and as a
majority of the cabinet had resolved so far to accede to the
motion as to appoint a commission of inquiry, Mr. Stanley, Sir
James Graham, the Duke of Richmond, and the Earl of Ripon
resigned their offices.&nbsp; The other measures of the ministry
with regard to Ireland were equally embarrassing in their
results.&nbsp; The unadvised disclosures of Mr. Littleton to Mr.
O&rsquo;Connell, respecting the supposed intentions of the
cabinet as to the Coercion Bill, led to the retirement of Earl
Grey, and Viscount Melbourne became Prime Minister in his
stead.&nbsp; The measures proposed for the relief of Dissenters
were withdrawn from the opposition of Dissenters themselves; and
the only act passed this session, of great public importance, was
that for the amendment of the Poor Laws, which received the
assent of almost all parties.&nbsp; Mr. Hume&rsquo;s motion for a
gradual repeal of the Corn Laws was negatived by 312 to
155&mdash;Sir James Graham being the principal speaker against
it.&nbsp; In November, when the death of Earl Spencer removed
Lord Althorpe to the Upper House, and so further weakened the
Whigs, the King dismissed them, and called the Duke of Wellington

<h3>1835.</h3>
<p>As the Reform enthusiasm had passed away, the elections
resulted unfavourably for the Whigs&mdash;the great majority of
the counties returning Conservative members.&nbsp; The Whigs,
however, finding that they still possessed a majority in the new
house, set themselves to oppose Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s
Government on every point.&nbsp; They carried Mr. Abercromby, as
Speaker, by a majority of 10, and an amendment on the address by
a majority of 7.&nbsp; Sir Robert, however, continued to bring
forward his measures, some of which were generally approved of,
and he bade fair to gain the confidence of the country even under
such disadvantageous circumstances.&nbsp; But on the introduction
of the Tithe Bill for Ireland, Lord John Russell moved that no
settlement of Irish Church affairs would be satisfactory on any
other basis than that of appropriating its surplus revenues to
educational purposes; and this was carried by a majority of
27.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel and his colleagues then retired from
office, and Lord Melbourne again became Prime Minister.&nbsp; The
rest of the session was almost wholly spent in passing the
Municipal Reform Bill, and an attempt to carry a Bill for
regulating the Irish Church, which was so mutilated in the Lords
that ministers abandoned it.&nbsp; Consols averaged 91; wheat,
39s. 4d.</p>

Droitwich, over which John S. Pakington, Esq., presided; the
object being to rescue the Eastern Division from the hands of the

others.</p>

charge of any particular clergyman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 4&mdash;Mr. Sidebottom, as
Town Clerk of Worcester, examined before the House of Lords, as
one of the witnesses against the Municipal Corporations Reform
Bill.&nbsp; His testimony went to say that the Corporation, as it
was, was very good&mdash;that there was never any
jobbing&mdash;that the freemen had held their rights ever since
1540&mdash;that the freemen were become such by servitude or
birth, saying nothing about purchase&mdash;and that any
alteration must be for the worse.</p>

J. S. Pakington, Esq., was called to the chair by the meeting,

<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 8&mdash;<i>The Kidderminster
Messenger</i> started by Mr. Arthur Brough, a bookseller in that
town, and also carrying on a similar business at Stourport.&nbsp;
It at first professed to be a neutral newspaper, and, as such,
had an extensive circulation amongst men of all parties in
Kidderminster and the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Mr. Brough afterwards
thought he could, as a commercial speculation, improve the paper
by making it a thorough going Tory print, and he gave it the name
of the <i>Ten Towns&rsquo; Messenger</i>, alluding to ten towns
round Kidderminster in which it circulated.&nbsp; From this time
it was furious in its politics and in the language employed to
advocate its principles.&nbsp; It reached its greatest
circulation when it extended its labours to Birmingham; the news
of which town was given at much length, and it assumed,
consequently the additional title of <i>The </i><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span><i>Birmingham Times</i>.&nbsp; This was in
1839&ndash;40; and from 1,700 to 1,800 copies, weekly, were sold
at this time.&nbsp; In 1841, however, Mr. Brough started the
<i>National Advertiser</i>, by which he expected to make much
more money than by the <i>Ten Towns</i>, and in June, 1842, he
sold it to the Rev. Charles Eckersall.&nbsp; The Tractarian
principles which it now advocated were, however, by no means
palatable to the majority of its readers, and the circulation of
the paper gradually declined, till Mr. Eckersall&mdash;like most
other amateur newspaper proprietors, having lost much money by
it&mdash;got rid of it.&nbsp; The paper then became the property
of Mr. Friend, bookseller, of Kidderminster, but, from various
causes continued to fall off in circulation; and when it had sunk
to some 400 weekly, it was at last altogether discontinued on the
30th of June, 1849.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 25&mdash;Two superb pieces

<h3>1837.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subjects which occupied the
attention of the legislature this year were many and important,
but no measures of great public polity actually passed.&nbsp;
Ecclesiastical matters formed the prominent topic, and a bill to
abolish church rates, and provide for the reparation of churches,
by putting the property of bishops, deans, and chapters into
commission, was read a second time, but the majority was so
small, five votes only, that ministers could not proceed with
it.&nbsp; King William IV died on the 20th of June; and, in the
elections which followed the accession of the young Queen, the
Whigs with difficulty maintained their majority.&nbsp; Consols
averaged 91&frac12;; wheat averaged 55s. 10d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span>&mdash;Great excitement in
Bromsgrove over politico-parochial matters.&nbsp; Two parties
were appointed by the Conservative party at the usual
time&mdash;Easter week; but this appointment, on an appeal to Dr.
Phillimore, the Chancellor of the Diocese, was declared informal
and illegal.&nbsp; There was, consequently, a fresh election in
this month, when the whole parish was routed up to vote.&nbsp;
The result was, the choice of the two liberals&mdash;Messrs.
Ellins (who had 945 votes) and Hill (who had 915).&nbsp; The
Conservatives were Messrs. Edwards and Penn, who obtained 381 and
372 votes respectively.&nbsp; A scrutiny was demanded, and it
dragged out a weary length with all sorts of expenses, but left
the result of the election unaltered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 13&mdash;Bazaar at
Evesham, for the restoration of St. Lawrence&rsquo;s Church,

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 30&mdash;Public meeting of
the burgesses of Worcester at the Bell Inn, to consider the best
means of declaring their grateful sense of Mr. Hebb&rsquo;s
constant endeavours in the behalf of civil and religious liberty,
and their approval of his conduct during the two years he had
filled the office of chief magistrate.&nbsp; It was determined
that he should be requested to sit for his portrait, and <a

<p><span class="smcap">Irish</span> Tithes and
Corporations&mdash;Church Rates&mdash;Jamaica and the Negro
Apprenticeship System, and the Canadas&mdash;formed the subjects
of discussion in Parliament.&nbsp; In the year previous had
commenced that series of deficits which contributed so much to
the weakness and ultimate downfall of the Melbourne
administration: for finance is, after all, the life-blood of a
ministry.&nbsp; The Whigs could not, however, fairly be blamed
for the state of the national exchequer, which, in truth, was the
unavoidable consequence of the measures of former years.&nbsp;
Immediately after the restriction of small notes, in the year
1829, the prices of merchandise and the amount of mercantile
transactions rapidly declined; though as the seasons were
unfavourable, speculators managed, by aid of the sliding scale,
to keep up the price of corn till 1833, when it fell to less than
40s. a quarter.&nbsp; Speculation in the American trade gained
for a time the appearance of prosperity; but on the failure of
the United States Bank in 1836, affairs were brought to a crisis,
and our manufacturers and merchants were plunged into extreme
distress&mdash;trade was utterly stagnated&mdash;and when the
scarcity of 1839 necessitated large importations of corn, and a
drain of gold to pay for it, the Bank of England was well nigh
brought into the peril of 1825.&nbsp; Consols averaged 93; wheat
averaged 64s. 7d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The <i>Worcestershire

of which were some of the leading <a name="page291"></a><span

county.&nbsp; It was designed to supply a want, then beginning to
be generally felt by this party, of an organ for the advocacy of
their opinions, and the advancement of their interests through
the medium of the press.&nbsp; The first number was published on
the 3rd of January, 1838.&nbsp; In the year 1842 the concern
passed into private hands, and was transferred to the present
proprietors.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 22&mdash;Mr. Pakington made
his Parliamentary <i>deb&ucirc;t</i> in a speech on Canadian

<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;Subscriptions at

indignant at not having been consulted.&nbsp; The Liberals
afterwards <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> Mr. Williams at a dinner at the
George Inn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 27&mdash;Celebration of Lord
Ward&rsquo;s majority at Himley, Sedgley, Dudley, &amp;c., by a
succession of dinners and donations to the poor.&nbsp; The barrel
of ale called &ldquo;Big Ben,&rdquo; which had been brewed on
Lord Ward&rsquo;s natal day, and reserved especially for this
occasion, was tapped and distributed.&nbsp; His lordship layed
the first stone of a new church at Gornal, and afterwards
entertained a party of fifty gentlemen to a sumptuous feast at
Himley Hall.&nbsp; He declared himself a Conservative.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 28&mdash;Celebration of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s coronation in Worcester and other county
towns.&nbsp; In Worcester the Yeomanry and Militia, the Town
Council, 5,000 Sunday school children, and the various trade
companies made up a procession to the Cathedral, where a sermon
was preached by Dr. Faussett.&nbsp; 2,100 poor people dined at
the public expense in the Guildhall, Market House, and Sansome
Walk.&nbsp; 200 gentlemen dined together at the Shire Hall;
George Allies, Esq., Mayor, in the chair.&nbsp; Fireworks in the
evening; and a public breakfast for the ladies next morning in
the Shire Hall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 4&mdash;At the annual

Captain Emmott with a splendid service in silver, which had been

year gave a grand ball in the New Shire Hall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 27&mdash;A man named George
Burrows committed from Droitwich for stealing hay, made his
escape from the County Gaol, having managed to secrete himself in
the yard until all the rest of the prisoners were marched into
the chapel to attend service.&nbsp; All <a

<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 4&mdash;Consecration of
the church of St. Peter the Great, Worcester, by the Lord Bishop

Benson.&nbsp; The old building would only accommodate 350
persons; the present church contains 408 appropriated, and 624
free sittings.&nbsp; The total cost was &pound;3,600.&nbsp;
&pound;169 were collected after the services this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 6&mdash;Consecration of
Christ Church Chapel, Catshill, near Bromsgrove, by the Lord
Bishop of Rochester.&nbsp; This chapel, built for the
accommodation of a populous district, contains 520
sittings.&nbsp; &pound;45 were collected after a sermon by the
Bishop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 16&mdash;Great excitement
created at Bromsgrove and its neighbourhood, by the supposed
murder of a Redditch needle pointer, named Joshua Hollier.&nbsp;
He went to the Malt Shovel public house at Burcott, and was
drinking, quarrelling, and fighting there during the whole of
this (Sunday) afternoon, with &ldquo;navvies&rdquo; who worked on
the Birmingham and Gloucester line then making in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; He went out of the house about eight
o&rsquo;clock, and was soon after found lying on the ground
insensible.&nbsp; His shoes had been taken away.&nbsp; He was
brought into the house, and shortly afterwards died without
having spoken.&nbsp; The coroner&rsquo;s jury, after six
days&rsquo; examination of witnesses, returned a verdict of
wilful murder against John Rose, a &ldquo;navvie&rdquo; who went
to the house with him, and was supposed to have kicked the
deceased as he lay on the ground, and so caused his death.&nbsp;
He was heard afterwards to say he &ldquo;had given him
enough,&rdquo; and such like expressions.&nbsp; The grand jury
before whom the case came threw out the bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Whigs being reduced to an
extremity of weakness, resigned office in May, when the measures
they proposed to take with regard to Jamaica were only carried by
a majority of five.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel, however, was unable to
form a Government, because Her Majesty would not consent to
change the ladies of her bedchamber, and Lord Melbourne once more
assumed the Premiership.&nbsp; The Chartist disturbances at
Newport and elsewhere were the most notable occurrences of the
year.&nbsp; The <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

attention.&nbsp; Consols averaged 92&frac12;; wheat averaged 70s.

<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;Discussions on
Socialism rife in Worcester.&nbsp; Robert Owen having been
propounding his plans, John Brindley, head master of the
Oldswinford hospital, delivered a series of lectures to refute
him.&nbsp; A public controversy between them at the Guildhall
attracted great crowds.&nbsp; Dr. Malden took the chair, and
Brindley spoke first.&nbsp; Owen afterwards at great length gave
a rambling account of his opinions, till he at last gave
utterance to a very gross sentiment, at which a general yell
arose, and the proceedings terminated in the utmost
confusion.&nbsp; A vote of censure was passed on Owen in dumb
show, and the people were so excited that he narrowly escaped
some very rough treatment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 15&mdash;Bewdley first

<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;The gaol fever raged

than 209 prisoners were confined.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 18&mdash;The members for
this county who voted against Mr. Villiers&rsquo;s motion that
parties should be heard at the bar of the House against the Corn
Laws, were Mr. Bailey, Mr. Hawkes, General Lygon, Mr. Pakington,
Mr. Horace St. Paul, Captain Rushout, Sir T. Winnington, and
Captain Winnington.&nbsp; Colonel Davies and Lord M. Hill voted
for it, and Mr. Godson was absent.&nbsp; The motion was negatived
by 361 to 172.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 7&mdash;Public meeting of the
citizens of Worcester to sanction the newly formed <span

the chair, and gentlemen of all parties spoke warmly in support
of the Chamber.</p>
<h3>1840.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Parliament</span> was engaged for a great
part of the session with the question of privilege arising out of
the Stockdale and Hansard case.&nbsp; The Whigs continued to hold
office on most precarious tenure, being defeated in their
proposal to allow Prince Albert &pound;50,000 a year.&nbsp; A
want of confidence motion, however, proposed by Sir J. Yarde
Buller, resulted in a majority of 21 in their favour.&nbsp; The
happy marriage of the Queen with Prince Albert of Saxe <a

<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 4&mdash;The Board of
Guardians for the Pershore Union petitioned the House of Lords
for the dismissal of the assistant poor law commissioners, as a
useless and expensive body of men.&nbsp; The Rev. F. Best opposed
the motion, but it was carried by 25 to 5.&nbsp; The Droitwich
Guardians did the same.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 10&mdash;Her

which amounted to 100 guineas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 28&mdash;The Worcestershire

petition against any alteration of the Corn Laws.&nbsp; Sir A.

unanimously adopted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 18&mdash;A rule granted by

office of Mayor of that borough for three successive years.&nbsp;
This discreditable proceeding was taken under an obsolete statute

Tombs was elected in his stead.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;The <span

suggesting it is wholly due to the Rev. Thomas Pearson.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;The <i>Paul Pry</i> made
its appearance in Worcester, filled with scurrilous lampoons upon
individual character, and the agent in that city received a sound
horsewhipping in his own back parlour from one of the parties
libelled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 11&mdash;An excited church
rate contest in the parish of St. Martin, Worcester; the numbers
at the close of the poll being&mdash;for a rate of four-pence in
the pound, 185; against it, 183.&nbsp; A similar contest took
place in St. Peter&rsquo;s parish a few days afterwards, which
ended in a majority of 66 for the rate&mdash;185 votes for and
119 against it.</p>

of Bromsgrove, in an immense tent on the bowling green of the
Bell Inn.&nbsp; G. F. Iddins, Esq., filled the chair, and nearly
1,200 persons sat down at the tables.&nbsp; William Acton, Esq.,
Mr. Twamley, Rev. T. Ashwell, Mr. J. B. Crane, Mr. F. T. Elgie,
and the Rev. Mr. Blakeman were the chief speakers, and the
obnoxiousness of church rates (a subject of great agitation at
Bromsgrove) the chief theme.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 31&mdash;Silver bread basket
and waiter, pair of snuffers and tray presented to Captain Rayer
of Hillworth, by the tithepayers and titheowners of Castlemorton,

great tithes of that parish for twenty years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 7&mdash;The Beer House Bill,
introduced by Mr. Pakington, received the royal assent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 10&mdash;The Worcester
Bridge Trustees having determined to widen the bridge, and
offered a premium of ten guineas for the best plan, awarded the
same to Mr. E. L. Williams, in preference to the plans of Mr.
Daukes and Mr. Varden, by a majority of five.&nbsp; The bridge
has been widened in accordance with Mr. Williams&rsquo;s plan,
and the alteration proves to be both elegant and durable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 23&mdash;Several bodies
of dead infants found in an old house at Droitwich, where Mary
Hall, an aged crone of very eccentric habits, resided.&nbsp; Her
husband had been sexton of the parish of St. Peter&rsquo;s,
Droitwich, and during his last illness the woman had pretended to
see his duties properly performed.&nbsp; These bodies,
however&mdash;instead of taking the trouble to have them
buried&mdash;she had stowed away amidst a variety of remnants of
food and other odds and ends.&nbsp; The whole house was in a
state of most disgusting filth.&nbsp; Mr. Hughes held an inquest
on the skeletons, and verdicts of &ldquo;Died by the visitation
of God&rdquo; were returned.&nbsp; Mr. W. H. Ricketts protested
against all such proceedings, as unnecessary, and said that at
the Michaelmas Sessions he should move for the disallowance of
the expenses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 10&mdash;The boiler of a
new locomotive, which had been brought on the Birmingham and
Gloucester Railway for trial, exploded while standing in a shed
at the Bromsgrove Station, and two men in the Company&rsquo;s
employ, named Rutherford and Scaife, were killed.&nbsp; The
boiler plates were supposed not to have been of sufficient
thickness.</p>

<h3>1841.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Government having determined to
seek an escape from the exigencies of their financial position by
a reduction of the custom duties on articles of general
consumption, the party in the country, who had for some time been
seeking the abolition of all such duties, immediately assumed a
much greater importance.&nbsp; The article first chosen for
operation was sugar&mdash;Lord John Russell at the same time
giving notice that he intended to propose a fixed duty of 8s.
upon corn.&nbsp; The ministers, however, were defeated in their
proposal to reduce the sugar duties, by a majority of 36; and a
vote of want of confidence moved by Sir R. Peel, was carried by a
majority of one.&nbsp; Ministers then dissolved Parliament,
avowedly appealing to the country on their free trade
measures.&nbsp; The elections, however, were decidedly against
them.&nbsp; On the reassembling of Parliament an amendment was
carried on the address, by a majority of 91, and the Whigs
resigned.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel then took office, but nothing
more was done this year in the way of legislation&mdash;the
finances being made to square by adding the &pound;2,100,000
deficiency in the revenue to the National Debt.&nbsp; Consols
averaged 89; wheat, 64s. 4d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 20&mdash;Accident on the
Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, at Bredon.&nbsp; A train, in
passing through a deep cutting, had shaken down a large quantity
of earth, in which the engine became embedded, and ran off the
line.&nbsp; The chain connecting the engine and tender snapped,
and so no harm occurred to the passengers; but the stoker fell
between the two, and his legs being cut off in a most dreadful
manner, he soon afterwards died.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 26&mdash;The body of a
respectable young female, named Mary Anne Patrick, found in
Salwarpe Brook, under what at first <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>appeared to be very suspicious
circumstances.&nbsp; She had been visiting relations at Wichbold,
and went out on the Wednesday morning for a walk by herself, but
no tidings were afterwards heard of her.&nbsp; When nearly a week
had elapsed, the Bromsgrove fire engine was passing through the
brook, and the body suddenly came to the surface.&nbsp; There
appeared to be some severe wounds on the head, which of course
originated the belief that she had been murdered; but when a
<i>post mortem</i> examination came to be made, it was clear that
she had fallen a victim to the pernicious practice of tight
lacing, and had fallen into the brook in an apoplectic fit.&nbsp;
The coroner&rsquo;s jury returned an open verdict.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 25&mdash;The fatal affray
between Mr. Emanuel Maiden, of the Shakspere Inn, and John
Fisher, ostler at the Star Hotel, which caused so much excitement
in Worcester, occurred this evening.&nbsp; Maiden and Fisher had
long been upon bad terms, and this night, about half-past twelve
o&rsquo;clock, they unfortunately met in Angel Street, and a
furious quarrel took place.&nbsp; Maiden broke away from Sergeant
Chipp, who was trying to keep him back, and ran after
Fisher.&nbsp; Several witnesses said they saw Maiden strike
Fisher on the back of the head, and he fell across the
pavement.&nbsp; From the effects of the blow, or the fall, Fisher
died on the succeeding Wednesday; and after several days&rsquo;
inquiry, the coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a verdict of
manslaughter against Maiden.&nbsp; He was admitted to bail on
Judge&rsquo;s order, and tried at the ensuing Lent Assizes, when
he was found guilty, with a recommendation to mercy, and
sentenced to a month&rsquo;s imprisonment without hard
labour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 12&mdash;Bazaar and

Worcester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 6&mdash;The <span

sharp contest for the assistant surgeonship between Mr. T. Walsh
and Mr. Everett, the former of whom had 162, and the latter 130
votes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 18&mdash;Several daring
robberies committed on the road between Severn Stoke and
Tewkesbury, and a locksmith named Richard Kington found
dead&mdash;robbed, and apparently murdered&mdash;<a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>at Clifton,
about midway between Severn Stoke and Kempsey.&nbsp; The
coroner&rsquo;s jury returned a verdict of &ldquo;wilful
murder&rdquo; against a man of bad character living at Severn
Stoke.&nbsp; Kington&rsquo;s knife and tobacco were found in
Tippin&rsquo;s small clothes, and the waggoner&rsquo;s whip,
which he had been carrying, in an outhouse adjoining to
Tippin&rsquo;s abode.&nbsp; Tippin was tried at the ensuing
assizes, but was acquitted of the murder because there was some
doubt whether the hurts on the person of the deceased might not
have been caused by a cart wheel passing over his body; but he
was found guilty of robbing the deceased, and sentenced to
transportation for life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s</span> measures,
which he would not disclose &ldquo;till he was regularly called
in,&rdquo; proved to be a three per cent. income tax, a sliding
scale of duties on corn, intended to keep the price at 56s., and
a new tariff&mdash;all of which, in spite of many dissentients on
both sides of the house, he carried by large majorities.&nbsp;
Consols averaged 92; wheat, 57s. 3d.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">January</span>&mdash;New magistrates added
to the commission of the peace at Kidderminster and
Evesham.&nbsp; At Kidderminster, John Sutton Barber, George
Hooman, James Morton, John Welch, and Thomas Bradley,
Esquires.&nbsp; At Evesham, E. T. Perrott, Robert Blayney, and
John Thomas, Esquires.&nbsp; Of course all were
Conservatives.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">February</span> 16&mdash;In the division
on Lord John Russell&rsquo;s amendment to Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s
proposal to alter the sliding scale, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Borthwick,
Mr. Barneby, Mr. Godson, Mr. Hawkes, Mr. Pakington, Mr. Taylor,
General Lygon, and Mr. F. W. Knight, voted in the majority of 351
against the amendment, and Lord M. Hill and Sir T. Winnington,
Bart., in the minority of 228 in its favour.&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Wilde paired off in its favour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 1&mdash;The Worcester glove
manufacturers met and discussed Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s proposal
to reduce the duty on gloves in the new tariff, and said that
they should be obliged to cease to employ any men at all if it
was adopted.&nbsp; A deputation of the glovers <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>afterwards
waited on Lord Ripon, and Sir Thomas Wilde very ably stated their
case&mdash;a plea <i>ad misericordiam</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 26&mdash;Riots in Dudley, in
consequence of a reduction of wages amongst the nailors.&nbsp;
Several people hurt by the Enniskillen Dragoons, in clearing the
streets, and others committed to gaol.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 27&mdash;The Mayor of
Worcester (Edward Evans, Esq.), Mr. Alderman Hastings, Mr.
Alderman Lilly, and Mr. E. Webb, added to the Worcester Charity
Trustees, to fill up vacancies.&nbsp; The Conservatives presented
a petition, praying that the number of trustees might be
increased from fifteen to twenty-one, of course expecting that
the additional names would be appointed from their party, and so
they might obtain a preponderance in the body; but this was
opposed by the existing trustees, and the Lord Chancellor refused
to sanction it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 2&mdash;Sir Thomas Winnington
brought home his amiable bride (eldest daughter of Sir Compton
Domville) to Stanford Court, and was greeted by his tenantry and
neighbours in a very enthusiastic manner&mdash;triumphal arches,
music, strewing flowers, long processions, and other modes of
welcome being adopted to exhibit the feeling entertained towards
the honourable baronet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">July</span> 25&mdash;First stone of
Wittington Church laid by the Rev. W. R. Holden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 6&mdash;The colliers near

Yeomanry being called out, came upon them as they were proceeding
to violence at the Cotsall pits, and took ten men prisoners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 23&mdash;St. Michael&rsquo;s

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 15&mdash;Military

the Worcestershire Yeomanry was this year dispensed with, as many
of the troops had been engaged in harrassing service in the
collieries during the strikes; but the review was held in Hewell
Park&mdash;the inspecting officer being Colonel Thorne.&nbsp; The
whole regiment was afterwards invited by their colonel to dinner
in an immense tent near the hall&mdash;900 persons sitting down
to the feast.&nbsp; Amongst the company at the principal table
were Colonel Clive (chairman), Lord Lyttelton, Lord Foley, Earl
Somers, Viscount Eastnor, Lord Ward, Lord Sandys, Earl of
Dartmouth, Colonel Thorne, Sir William Clinton, Sir O. Wakeman,
Sir C. Throckmorton, J. H. H. Foley, Esq., J. S. Pakington, Esq.,

<p><span class="smcap">Distress</span> in the manufacturing
districts gave increased force and vigour to the anti-corn law
agitation; but Lord Howick&rsquo;s motion for a committee of
inquiry into the causes of that distress was negatived by a
majority of 306 to 191, and Mr. Villiers&rsquo;s annual motion
for a committee of the whole House upon the corn laws was
supported by only 125 members, while 381 voted against it.&nbsp;
The defeat of Sir James Graham&rsquo;s educational measure by the
opposition of the Dissenters was the most remarkable feature in
the Parliamentary year.&nbsp; In Scotland the year was most
signally marked by the secession of the non-intrusionist
ministers from the Established Church, carrying with them the
bulk of the laity&mdash;in Ireland, by the violence of the repeal
agitation, and the arrest of Mr. O&rsquo;Connell&mdash;and in
Wales, by the singular outbreak against turnpike gates, known as
the Rebecca riots.&nbsp; Consols averaged 95; wheat averaged 50s.

<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 4&mdash;The Worcester
magistrates, at their quarter sessional meeting, appointed Mr.
Herbert Budd as surgeon to the City Gaol, in the room of Mr. F.
Walter, retired.&nbsp; The Council had claimed the right to see
to all the expenses of the gaol, and not leave the supply of
provisions in the hands of the visiting magistrates; and the
magistrates claimed the right of appointing all officers, under
the 38th clause of 1st Vict., cap. 78.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 17&mdash;Dinner to the Dudley
magistrates, to express approval of their conduct during recent
disturbances.&nbsp; Lord Ward presided, and Lord Lyttelton and
about one hundred other gentlemen were present.&nbsp; The
magistrates had refused to accept as bail for Chartists <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>persons of
the same political opinions, and the matter had been made subject
of severe comment in the House of Commons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>&mdash;The Dissenters throughout
the county petitioned urgently against the educational measures
proposed by Government.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> 20&mdash;A meeting held at
Bromsgrove, with the view of alleviating the distress of the
nailors, whom low wages, and a strike in consequence, had reduced
to a condition of grievous wretchedness.&nbsp; The Right Hon. and
Rev. Lord Aston took the chair, and a subscription was entered
into, and a goodly sum raised, to be laid out under the
management of a committee.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 1&mdash;A Commission of
Inquiry opened at the Angel Inn, Pershore, into the conduct of
the Rev. William Smith, Vicar of Overbury.&nbsp; The
commissioners appointed by the Bishop were Dr. Phillimore,
Chancellor of the Diocese; Archdeacon Timbrill; Rev. F. D. Gilby;
Rev. T. A. Strickland; and Rev. W. Parker.&nbsp; The charges
preferred by the parishioners were twenty-two in number, and were
supported by Mr. Elgie&mdash;Mr. Foley appearing for the
vicar.&nbsp; The inquiry lasted four days, and a great number of
witnesses were examined <i>pro.</i> and <i>con.</i>&nbsp; On the
18th, the chancellor pronounced the decision of the Commission in
the Lady Chapel at the Cathedral, Worcester.&nbsp; Many of the
charges were abandoned; and of those that remained, the
chancellor said that on six a <i>prima facie</i> case had been
made out for the Bishop to institute further proceedings.&nbsp;
These were, the removal of tombstones without a faculty; thrice
forcibly expelling the clerk during the service; placing persons
in the singing gallery to &ldquo;read him down;&rdquo; refusing
to ask the prayers of the congregation for a parishioner; and
interfering in the election of churchwardens.&nbsp; There was
also a special presentment as to his general conduct.&nbsp; As
the Rev. gentleman refused to submit the matter to the Bishop,
further proceedings were referred to the superior courts, but
none were taken.&nbsp; The Bishop afterwards addressed an
admonitory letter to the Rev. gentleman, which was published, and
drew from him a very singular reply.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 2&mdash;A porter on the
Birmingham and Gloucester Railway, named John Killcash, having
been drinking in the evening, laid himself down upon the rails
and fell asleep.&nbsp; The next train which came up severed his
head from his body.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 8&mdash;The Queen Dowager
took up her abode at Witley Court.&nbsp; Triumphal arches, and
other methods of welcome, were adopted at Droitwich.&nbsp; On the
following Monday week Her Majesty visited Worcester, and attended
divine service in the Cathedral.&nbsp; <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>Her return
was to have been a public progress, but the torrents of rain
which descended spoilt the whole affair; so that all the civic
dignitaries could do was to rush down the Guildhall steps in
their scarlet robes, just as Her Majesty passed, and bow their
acknowledgments at the carriage door.&nbsp; On the evening after,
the tradesmen honoured by Her Majesty&rsquo;s patronage
illuminated their houses.&nbsp; The Queen Dowager afterwards sent
a cheque for &pound;100 to the funds of the Worcester
Infirmary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 19&mdash;The first stone of

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 7&mdash;Messrs. Cobden and
Bright visited Worcester, in furtherance of the anti-corn law
agitation, and addressed an audience of about 1,200 people in the
Guildhall.&nbsp; The High Sheriff refused to call a county
meeting; therefore Edward Holland, Esq., took the chair.&nbsp;
But a small proportion of the meeting were farmers.&nbsp; There
was a show of opposition on the part of the Chartists, but it was
very feeble and soon put down.&nbsp; The corn law repealers
afterwards had a dinner at the Bell Inn; W. B. Collis, Esq., in
the chair, and Robert Hardy, Esq., vice-president.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 29&mdash;The new parish

&pound;5,000, and it contains 1,457 sittings&mdash;781 of which

occupied with many exciting subjects; especially the state of
Ireland, then agitated by the proceedings on Mr.

factories; and the Dissenters&rsquo; Chapel Bill.&nbsp; The
financial measures of the year were likewise very important;
including, as they did, the reduction of the Three-and-half per
Cents., and the passing of the Bank Restriction Act&mdash;an act,
the wisdom of which is yet to be determined.&nbsp; Mr.

purpose of carrying Free Trade measures when Lord John Russell
had failed to form a Government.&nbsp; His measure for a gradual
reduction of the duties on corn was ordered to go into committee,
after twelve nights&rsquo; debate, by a majority of 337 to
240.&nbsp; After the settlement of the new commercial policy, the
Government was defeated by a union of the Whigs and
Protectionists, in a proposal to carry a bill for the repression
of outrage in Ireland; and this was followed by Sir Robert
Peel&rsquo;s retirement from office, which had for some time been
foreseen as unavoidable.&nbsp; Lord John Russell then became
Premier.&nbsp; Consols averaged 95&frac12;; wheat, 54s. 8d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 11&mdash;The Worcester New Gas
Company&rsquo;s Bill went into committee.&nbsp; The Marquis of
Granby, as chairman, suggested an amicable arrangement between
the New and Old Companies.&nbsp; The committee accordingly
adjourned for two days, and an agreement was then effected,
principally by the zealous endeavours of Sir Thomas Wilde.&nbsp;
The New Company consented to become purchasers of the Old
Company&rsquo;s plant, works, and stock at a valuation by
arbitrators, and to pay &pound;1,000 over and above the
valuation, but to give nothing for &ldquo;goodwill;&rdquo; this

way of an arrangement.</p>

the paper being afterwards identified with the <i>Worcester

influential parties in London, during the years 1833 and 1834,
for the purpose of regaining the power which the Conservative
party lost in the Reform Bill agitation.&nbsp; It fought the
battles of the party with much fidelity; and during the years in
which Mr. George Hyde was editor, its attacks upon the Liberals
were distinguished by a good deal of smartness and ability,
though too highly seasoned with personality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> terrible condition of Ireland,
and the decimation of its inhabitants by famine, occupied the
greater share of the attention of Parliament.&nbsp; The Corn and
Navigation Laws were entirely suspended until towards the close
of the year; in spite of which, the average price of wheat in May
was 100s. 5d.&nbsp; The issuing of the Minutes of the Council on
Education, which have since been acted upon, and the increase of
the grant to &pound;100,000 per annum for the purpose of carrying
them into effect, may be regarded as the most important measure
of the year.&nbsp; Parliament was dissolved in July, and the
elections tended to confirm the predominance of Free Trade

November.&nbsp; Consols averaged 87; wheat, 69s. 9d.</p>

this estate, with others in different parts of the country, was
purchased, set out into lots, and divided to the few drawers of
prizes in a lottery to which thousands of others had subscribed,
was one of the hugest delusions to which the working men of this
country ever lent themselves under demagogue leadership.&nbsp;
They allowed themselves to be persuaded, not only that to leave
their manual handicraft and become squatters on an acre or two of
ground would be the climax of independence and happiness, but
that by some legerdemain of compound interest, their money and
estates would be so reproductive that all the subscribers would
in a few years get allotments, which, being freehold, would give
them immense political power, and be the regeneration of the
land.&nbsp; The fortunate allottees soon found that they did not
hold the fee simple of their acres, but were called upon by
O&rsquo;Connor to pay a large rent, and being unaccustomed to
husbandry were speedily reduced to the condition of ruined
paupers, subsistent on the charity of the farmers among whom they
were located.&nbsp; The affairs of the company are now being
wound up under an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">August</span> 17&mdash;A Provincial Grand

<p><span class="smcap">February</span>&mdash;The Corn Exchange
dispute now raged in Worcester, being made in great measure a
question of politics; the Protectionists supporting the proposal
to build a new exchange in Angel Street, and the Free Traders
insisting on the old site, from which they contended it could not
be removed without much injustice to the shopkeepers and owners
of property in the Corn Market.&nbsp; The Mayor, Mr. Webb, made
many strenuous efforts to effect an amicable arrangement between
the parties, but without success; and the silly result was, that
instead of uniting the funds to build a handsome hall that would
have been a credit to the city, two were built.&nbsp; The
erection in Angel Street entailed great loss upon the
subscribers; and the handsome room in the Corn Market, though
left without many embellishments which had been intended to be
added, was a ruinous affair both to the shareholders and the
contractor.&nbsp; As the agriculturists all steadfastly attended
the Angel Street room, the one in the Corn Market was at last
obliged to be closed as a corn exchange, and was sold under the
Joint Stock Company&rsquo;s Winding-up Act for
&pound;1,710&mdash;the price to the shareholders being upwards of
&pound;4,000.&nbsp; It is now transformed into a very handsome
Music Hall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 22&mdash;The Worcestershire
Agricultural Protection Society dissolved itself, and voted its

afford reliable data for comparing the relative increase of
different religious denominations, because a considerable

<p>*&nbsp; The first series of these observations at Worcester
were taken by Mr. T. R. Hill, at the Literary and Scientific
Institution, and those for 1849&ndash;51 by Dr. Turley, St.
John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It would seem as though less rain fell in
this neighbourhood than in other parts of the county; but the
years given happen to be amongst the drier ones, and in general
it will be found that more rain falls at Worcester than in most
other parts of England.&nbsp; The mean height of the thermometer
in the midland districts of England is about 50&deg;, at
Worcester the mean will be found slightly to exceed that
figure.</p>
<p>&dagger; From observations taken by Mr. Hunter of Mawley
Gardens.</p>
<p>&#8225; From observations taken by Mr. T. H. Davis of Orleton,
who possesses an accurate register of the rain which has fallen
in each month for the last twenty years.&nbsp; The result shows
May to be the driest, and November the wettest, month, and gives
2.19 as the average of January; February, 2.21; March, 1.91;

candidate for the representation whenever a vacancy should occur,
professing Radical opinions.&nbsp; The Conservatives brought
forward Mr. Charles M&lsquo;Garel, who declared himself a
supporter of Lord Derby&rsquo;s Government; but as he was not
explicit on the subject of &ldquo;Protection,&rdquo; he found so
little favour with the voters, that after four days&rsquo;
canvass he left the city.&nbsp; Mr. Laslett was then returned

support Lord Derby&rsquo;s Government in other matters.&nbsp; The

Derby&rsquo;s Government according to their measures, though a
thorough Free Trader.&nbsp; He thus obtained the support of the
Whig and Radical parties in the borough, and also of a section of
the moderate Conservatives.&nbsp; He was returned on the poll by

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
